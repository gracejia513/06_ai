### Part 1: Rerunning 010-062 using gay_seattle data
Every coding exercise were executed again to replicate the gay_seattle pratical exercies. Most of the codes can be replicated smoothly, however I identified some minor issues that might be due to personal PC's configuration. Here are some screenshots and notes for future reference.

  <summary><b>Troubleshoot</b></summary>

1. [package installation](https://github.com/gracejia513/06_ai_deliverable/blob/main/Troubleshoot01.png?raw=true) The extra package spacy can be downloaded using !python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

2. [drive mount](https://github.com/gracejia513/06_ai_deliverable/blob/main/Troubleshoot02.png?raw=true) It is better to mount to personal Google drive than that of using UW's email

3. [missing font](https://github.com/gracejia513/06_ai_deliverable/blob/main/Troubleshoot03.png?raw=true) verdana.ttf was missing in the asset.

### Part 3: Comparison summary
The book *Native Seattle* illustrates a place-based story that connects the early and the contemporary native community in Seattle. Native people and places played a vital part in the founding of Seattle and in what the city is today, just as urban changes transformed what it meant to be Native.
