history the two were considered mutually exclusive uw mscua this plan of the battle of seattle in january drawn by a naval officer involved in the conflict shows the lagoon where little crossingover place once stood it also shows indigenous settlements in and around town depicted with marks that look suspiciously like plainsstyle tipis as well as the woods thronged with indians on the slopes above the settlement uw these native men likely employees at henry yeslers sawmill were photographed standing in front of yeslers cookhouse in their labor like that of many other local indigenous people made seattle early survival possible uw julia yesler daughter of henry yesler and a duwamish woman represented the seattle illahee of mixedrace families which both illustrated the importance of native people to town life and caused consternation among some white settlers photo courtesy of kathie zellerberg this handbill warning of smallpox the oldest extant piece of printed material from seattle does not directly mention native people but nonetheless exhibits the intense anxiety about urban disease outbreaks for which indians were often blamed uw this birds eye view of seattle created by a man named glover includes a tiny flotilla of native canoes and an indian encampment marked here with a black box it does not however show the many other kinds of native presence in and

although she was revered by many as indian royalty kikisebloo was also mocked and maligned and her shanty was seen by some as evidence that seattle needed to clean up its urban landscape uw na chesheeahud and tleebooleetsa also known as lake union john and madeline were among the handful of duwamish people who obtained homesteads in and around seattle in the late nineteenth century like kikisebloo they were often portrayed as remnants of a vanishing race however this photograph shows the persistence of some indigenous people in traditional places as well as the continued connections

ceased to exist uw sea seetoowathl who lived in a floathouse on the duwamish river just below the view in the postcard on the facing page was an important source of information about indigenous geography in the seattle area he and his wife starved to death during the winter of the seattle waterfront including ballast island was sometimes described as the venice of the pacific because of the many native canoes moored there some were duwamish others belonged to people from far away photograph attributed to john p soule uw na encampments of native migrants like this one just south of the downtown business district but incorrectly labeled as ballast island were common sights in seattle during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries photograph by anders b wilse mohai this native woman photographed at an encampment near first avenue and king street in is most likely nuuchahnulth from the west coast of vancouver island journeys like hers often taken annually linked seattle to native communi ties as far away as southeast alaska photograph by oliver phelps anderson mohai shs just as native people moved in seattle indian hinterland so too did native imagery the

tilikums of elttaes shown here on parade during the golden potlatch of enthusiastically adopted savage symbolism for their displays of civic boosterism illustrating the extent to which the indian hinterland also transformed seattle urban vocabulary uw native vendors of curios were a common sight on seattle streets as this postcard shows and sometimes even within the aisles of department stores along with agricultural labor in the fields of western washington such urban entrepreneurship became part of an annual routine for many northwest coast families mohai taken in this photograph captures the interaction between a white woman and a native basket vendor most likely makah or nuuchahnulth photograph by webster and stevens mohai baskets and other objects purchased from native vendors often ended up in the curio corners of elite seattle homes as in this mill owners parlor photograph by anders b wilse mohai the alaskayukonpacific exposition aype was seattle coming out party and an articulation of the city urban identity not surprisingly the million or so visitors to the fair encountered many kinds of native imageryand sometimes even real indians uw ayp native people from

unidentified mother uw ayp the big bug official mascot of seattle potlatch festivals drew on racist caricatures of northwest coast art just as those who organized the potlatches conducted cannibalistic ceremonies to initiate new members into their tribe uw ashford collection while potlatch organizers drew on totem poles and other northern imagery to create an urban vocabulary pioneers such as these photographed in by theodore peiser at the alki landing monument crafted an entirely different kind of urban narrative instead of using indian imagery to advertise a bright future pioneers often used indian imagery to lament a disappearing past mohai peiser although they had little say in the creation of urban narratives local native com munities did participate in urban commemorations and told their own stories of seattle here suquamish tribal members perform at chief seattle day festivities in uw na in ernest bertelson took this photograph of several unidentified native people in the heart of pioneer square as early as the s this neighborhoodthe origi nal skid roadwas already home to an urban indian community uw na in the late s the american indian womens

index preface o nce upon a timemeaning in the early phases of grad uate schooli had the idea that i was going to have to write about everything that ever happened to every indian per son in seattle but i soon realized that this was neither pos sible nor would it make a book anyone wanted to read the stories included in this book then are intended simply as examples of the kinds of experiences native people have had in the city and its hinterland and just as important how those experiences have intersected with larger questions about urban development and urbanity itself as with the duwamish and their struggle for recognition i hope that this book will create new opportunities for indian people in seattle to speak about their lives and be heard even if the stories they tell differ markedly from or even contradict the broader urban narrative i have written and the narrative is indeed intended to be a broad one stretching from before the landing of the denny party at alki beach in to the beginning of the twentyfirst century chapter sets the stage by examining the current state of seattle placestory which is domi nated by metaphorical indians and the notionpromulgated both by scholarly literature and by popular culturethat urban and native his tories are somehow mutually exclusive the narrative then continues with two chronological chapters chapter retells the founding of seat tle as a complex historical process a longue dur√©e rather than a snap shot singularity which took place within a dynamic landscape whose indigenous inhabitants shaped the founding process in important ways chapter examines the even greater role that indigenous people such as the duwamish played in the creation of an urban frontier on puget sound throughout seattle village period the s through x i i i the s the duwamish and other indian people literally made seat tle possible through their labor and their participation in town life even as they were scapegoated as symbols of urban disorder chapter is the first of two hinges in the narrative both focusing closely on seattle indian landscapes during narrowly defined but crit ically important periods of change in seattle urban native histories the first hinge in the s uses the federal census and other fine grained sources to show a nascent city in which multiple kinds of indian historyof local indigenous people native migrants to the city and indian images in the urban vocabularybegan to intersect in com plicated ways the second hinge chapter focuses on the s when these three histories had matured into dominant facets of seattle urban story and when the city stood poised for the transformative experience of the second world war chapters instead of proceeding chronologically each look at one of these three native histories in the period between the two hinges of the s and the s chapter examines the experiences of local indigenous people through seattle massive environmental transfor mations and their neartotal dispossession from the urban landscape through the seemingly selffulfilling prophecy of the vanishing race chapter is about the creation of a vast native hinterland woven together by the movement of indian people and things to and from seattle and places along the broader northwest coast nonindians use of indian imagery to tell and sell seattle story and contention over what exactly that story was are the subjects of chapter after the second hinge of chapter the final two chapters exam ine the postwar period through two related but distinct stories chap ter is about the multiethnic panindian urban community that took shape in the postwar years while chapter is about the resurgence of local tribes such as the duwamish in the arena of civic discourse both chapters illustrate the ongoing legacies of earlier periods in seattle native pasts the ways in which indian people have claimed space and authority within the city and how these legacies and claimings con tinue to interact with seattle native symbolism and urban storyline the idea that indians and cities are mutually exclusiveor more x i v to the point that native people do not belong in urban placesis in addition to being an outgrowth of broader american ideas about prog ress also a result of the simple fact that indian people can be very hard to find in cities collecting the histories included in this book was at times like looking for a handful of needles in an even greater number of haystacks i always operated however under the axiom that absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence and so made few assumptions about what kinds of sources might include references to native people i used the sources typical of any ethnohistorical project such as anthropologists field notes oral tradition indian agents reports and archaeological studies i also mined standard sources of urban social and cultural historymemoirs newspapers locally produced neighbor hood studies federal censuses and subscription historiesfor any men tion of native people in many cases these sources had to be analyzed on two levels i used them both to establish the presence of native people and to assess nonindian attitudes about the presence of native people in the city lastly i spent a great deal of time examining urban sources such as engineers reports that made no mention of indians at all it was here that absences turned into evidence by triangulating between these sources native sources such as oral tradition or indigenous top ographical names and sources speaking to the environmental conse quences of urban transformation i was able to link both engineers and eldersand thus urban and indian historiesthrough close attention to place and environmental change the highly interdisciplinary even omnivorous methodologies of environmental history were thus criti cal to unearthing seattle native pasts unearthing those pasts also involved resurrecting the racism of the past while looking for nonindian narratives about indian people in the city i all too often encountered words and phrases that have been used to demean marginalize and even kill native men and especially women some people fear that repeating such racist language perpet uates racism i am of the belief however that the only way that we can talk critically about racism is to understandand see clearlythe lan guage that reinforced it let me say here that i understand as much as any gay white man truly can the pain associated with terrible words p r e f a c e x v such as squaw siwash or savage and with the mischaracteriza tion of native women as prostitutes i hope that the reader will under stand that my use for example of quotations containing these words and ideas was done with the goal of laying bare the ignorance and racism of the past i also hope that this book will contribute to the ongoing struggle against the ignorance and racism of the present which if often masked run surprisingly deep writing native histories in english is by definition an imprecise art scholars and tribal people have come up with many ways for example to write down whulshootseed words even the name itself is up for debate some call it puget sound salish while others call it lushoot seed whulshootseed is the southern seattlearea dialect version of the name with nonspecialist readers in mind in the main text of this book i have used indigenous names for local places only in english transla tion readers interested in more detailed information on these places including the whulshootseed versions of their names should visit the atlas at the back of the book there the whulshootseed names are spelled using a practical orthography developed by atlas coauthor nile thomp son within the main text i have chosen to spell individual native peoples indian nameswhulshootseed or otherwiseusing english approximations at times these spellings differ from those in most his torical sources for example the man after whom seattle is named is referred to in this book as seeathl rather than as seattleor sealth another common anglicization of his nameboth to distinguish the individual from the city and the chief seattle speech attributed to him and to suggest a pronunciation as close as possible to the whulshoot seed original it should be pronounced something like seeahthl with the break between syllables like the break in uhoh and the final sound like the welsh ll i hope that any loss of linguistic integrity will be compensated for by greater readability w ithout a doubt the most important collaborators in a project like this are native people themselves there is no longer any reason or excuse for a scholar to write indian history without the active participation of tribal x v i people the muckleshoot indian tribe in my hometown of auburn washington granted me access to oral histories dealing with seattle and supported my interest in publishing the material included in this books atlas i especially want to thank the members of the tribes cul ture committee tribal staff members and archaeologist lynn larson who suggested that i talk to the muckleshoot in the first place with out the accounts of ollie wilbur art williams and other muckleshoot community members this would have been a very different and much less interesting book the duwamish tribe of seattle on the other hand chose to partic ipate only indirectly in this project i am grateful for the suggestions they did make and have done my best to incorporate them and to include duwamish voices past and present garnered from archival and press sources wherever possible based on what i know of the tribes archives and oral tradition through conversations with other researchers i am not convinced that the overall shape of this book would have been rad ically different had the duwamish participated more directly it might have included some additional specific information on the mixedrace families of seattle illahee a few more details about the break in duwamish leadership and a clearer picture of what duwa mish community members were doing between that alleged break and their new visibility beginning in the s but my portrayal of the roles that their ancestors played in early seattle history and the part present day tribal members have played in reshaping the city narrative would likely change little my hope is that this book will spark even greater public interest in the duwamish and their stories and i wish them the best in their continued search for federal recognition and in their efforts to build a longhouse on the river that bears their name because this book is not only about the indigenous peoples of seat tle and their descendants it was important to gain insights from within the multiethnic pantribal urban indian community in the city i espe cially want to thank teresa brownwolf powers and indirectly the amer ican indian womens service league for granting me access to hours of unedited interviews teresa taped with service league members as with the tribal oral histories these interviews filled what would have p r e f a c e x v i i otherwise been silence sandy osawa roger fernandes and jeanette bushnell also helped me think about presentday urban native issues and my interview with former skid road queen bill regan provided a window into a community that left virtually no records behind if noth ing else these people proved just how diverse and complex seattle urban indian community is there is also a person whose life and history sit at the crossroads of almost all of seattle various indian histories and who deserves special praise for her generosity and insightfulness although a member of the muckleshoot tribe where she also works as a grant administrator jackie swanson is also the greatgranddaughter of chesheeahud a duwa mish man who figures prominently in seattle early history she was also deeply involved in the american indian womens service league in the s and through that experience knew intimately the nowlargely disappeared world of indian skid road whether sharing her own writ ings about the history and significance of the service league inviting me to examine old photos of powwows and other events or showing me the baskets made by chesheeahuds daughter julia siddle her grand mother jackie helped me see just how closely interwoven these histo ries are and offered insights in a truly compassionate helpful way several remarkable scholars have been generous guides along the way to this book john findlay took great interest in my personal and professional development reeled me in during some of my more exces sive flights of fancy and helped me understand what the word edit really means richard white quietly encouraged me to say what i mean and do it clearly and his willingness to continue advising this project after his departure from the university of washington to stanford uni versity speaks volumes about his commitment to students gail dubrow reminded me to connect the work to the concerns of real people and supported my interests in public history if sasha harmon was an invaluable resource for her expertise in local indian affairs then she has also proved an excellent trimmer of awkward prose suzanne leb sock and jim gregory both members of my phd committee provided important insights as well despite the fact that urban indian histories are far removed from their own areas of interest x v i i i the support of my fellow graduate students improved this work nearly as much as the advice i received from my faculty i began graduate school with a cohort of americanists whose names will no doubt become well known within the discipline in years to come jen seltz roberta gold andrea geiger michael witgen connie chiang jeff brune and liz escobedo the hours that ithe local guyspent with them in read ings courses and research seminars kept me from being provincial ray rast joined us later and was a kindred spirit thanks to his inter ests in place landscape and memory i also received encouragement and criticismas well as lessons on writing for audiences who do not spend their days thinking about native issuesfrom susan smith ali igmen michael reese david biggs and joe roza among others ned blackhawk pam creasy and pauline escudero shafer kept me honest as a white guy doing indian history when my own writing bogged down i often turned to kate browns beautiful study of the ukrainian border lands for inspiration matt klingle however deserves more credit than any other graduate colleague while writing his companion volume an environmental history of seattlematt was both big brother and research assistant offering personal and professional guidance while also keeping an eye out for native people in the archives i look forward to seeing his book next to this one on the shelf lisa scharnhorst sandra kroupa carla rickerson gary lundell and the other staff of the university of washington special collections deserve praise for their tolerance interest in my research and deep knowledge of the trove they guard beyond the university of washington many other people made this book possible john lutz of the univer sity of victoria helped me flesh out the british columbia side of things while paige raibmon now a colleague at the university of british columbia offered important insights arising from the intersections between our two projects carolyn marr and howard giske guided me through the museum of history and industrys collections while greg lange and the staff of the puget sound branch of the washington state archives in bellevue suggested sources i never would have thought to examine miriam waite and the daughters of the pioneers honored me both with a small scholarship and with an afternoon among the descen p r e f a c e x i x dants of people who appear herein local historian david buerge deserves credit for writing a series of seattle weekly articles that inspired my interest in seattle indigenous history in the first place peripatetic anthropologist jay miller helped with insights into local oral tradition and language and with one eye on the local details and the other on the broader scholarship lorraine mcconaghy was a compatriot in civic iconoclasm and a counselor in times of academic insecurity her pas sion and rigor helped to make this a better book and me a better scholar local historical and ecological activists such as david williams valerie rose tom dailey monica wooton paul talbert georgina kerr and others proved to me that there was an audience for this history to some degree this book was written for people like them i hope it inspires them to continue their efforts to engage the places where they live and the histories to which they are party as editor of the weyerhaeuser environmental series of which this book is the first indiancentered volume bill cronon encouraged me to rethink whether this book belonged in the series and provided noth ing but enthusiasm along the way julidta tarver meanwhile kept me on track for publication showed great warmth during some trying times and paid me a great deal of attention despite the fact that she is semiretired from the university of washington press two anonymous reviewers also provided critically important feedback on the manuscript seeing things i no longer could after all the years of living with this project pam bruton deserves credit for the thankless task of copyedit ing and marilyn trueblood oversaw the production of the book at the press two collaborators deserve their own paragraph nile thompson a gifted linguist with an eye for detail to say the least has made an irre placeable contribution through his work on the atlas of indigenous seattle at the end of this book i dread to think what might have ended up in print without his expertise in salish linguistic structure and world view his working knowledge of whulshootseed and his attention to fine nuances of logic and evidence now i truly understand why lin guistics is its own discipline and why historians should keep to their own turf amir sheikh who designed the maps for the atlas was both x x a stalwart friend and an intellectual coconspirator as he pursues grad uate studies of his own i only hope i can contribute as much to amirs future scholarship as he has already contributed to mine finally this book is dedicated to three people who have shaped my life in profound ways first robert h keller jr the resident historian at western washington universitys fairhaven college saved me from law school and showed me that all the things i cared about in fact counted as history it is difficult to imagine having been anything other than a historian and i have bob to thank for that second my husband simon martin has been my therapist keel and accountant through the neu roses and vagaries of graduate school and the academic life over the past dozen years he has sacrificed a great deal in my pursuit of a career but i think he would agree that its been worth it lastly this book is dedicated to my mother paula thrush who died of cancer in febru ary and thus never had the chance to see this published or even to know that id been offered a position at the university of british columbia she made me who i am through her utter inability to sit still and do nothing through her passion for place and the environment and through her unswerving if not always uncritical support of her only child i wish i could talk to her again p r e f a c e x x i native seattle foreword present haunts of an unvanished past william cronon a mong the oldest most powerful and most pernicious of all ideas associated with the american frontier is the myth of the vanishing race the story it tells is of settlers from across the ocean or from far corners of the continent coming to a new land and finding there an abundant eden rich in resources and inhabited by native peoples enjoying natures bounty in harvests that entailed little labor to improve the soil sometimes the myth portrays these native inhabitants as savages who for no good reason seek to destroy their new neighbors with unjustified acts of wanton violence sometimes the myth presents indians far more favorably as a noble race choosing to live lightly on the land behaving with great honor and generosity toward new arrivals whom they could easily have viewed as invaders but whom instead they supported with gifts of food and other necessities of life only turning to violence after provocations so awful that no reasonable person could expect anyone to endure them but how ever the frontier myth portrays american indians whether negatively or positively it almost always ends in a transformed landscape in which wilderness has given way to civilization and strikingly native peoples have vanished from the scene poignant though this narrative may some times seem it has always been a cruel lie distorting the actual lives and histories of peoples who remain fully present in the transformed land scape despite the failure of historical narratives to notice their ongoing presence in it scholars and activists have been critiquing the myth of the vanish ing race for decades so by now its many distortions of american indian history should hardly come as a surprise yet it persists for many rea sons its oldest ideological purpose was undoubtedly to help forgive the v i i invaders their invasionby implying that whatever the intentions on either side an uncivilized people could not survive their encounter with the civilized people who would replace them sad though their vanishing might be no one was really to blame for itor so the story would have us believe subtler aspects of the myth reinforce this mes sage by casting frontier settlement in heroic terms with honorable men and women on both sides coming into tragic conflict in the struggle to build a new nation indians and settlers alike can be represented as grander nobler larger than life to the extent that the frontier has served as a defining feature of american nationalism since the nineteenth cen tury this heroic tale has proved to be an enduring resource for amer ican national identity furthermore the american devotion to romantic nature that emerged simultaneously as part of the same nationbuild ing process had the consequence of tying indians to a wilderness land scape that came to symbolize an older simpler purer world that a fallen humanity could now no longer inhabit strikingly the movement to set aside national parks and wilderness preserves was nearly simulta neous with the movement of indian tribes onto reservations so that human inhabitants were made to vanish from the american wilder ness as a selffulfilling prophecy of its unpeopled nature y et there is a lessnoticed aspect of the myth of the vanishing race that is arguably just as problematic perhaps in part because indian peoples have long been associated with nature it has been remarkably easy not to notice their pres ence in places that are marked as unnatural in american under standings of landscape chief among these are urban and metropolitan areas which for more than a century have provided homes for people of american indian descent to a much greater degree than most people realize although there is a widespread assumption that most indians live on reservations in fact many more live outside the bound aries of those legal homelands with a substantial fraction living in cities in the us census for the year for instance new york city was home to full or mixedblood american indians alaskan natives and native hawaiians compared with in los angeles v i i i in chicago and comparably large numbers in most other cities to the extent that actual indians did indeed vanish from various parts of the continent it wasnt because they had ceased to exist they had simply migrated elsewhereoften like so many other americans to urban areas perhaps most strangely of all when native peoples occu pied sites where the forces of urbanization were greatest they found themselves becoming invisiblenot to themselves of course but to their new neighborsin the very places that had always been their homes it is this ironic storyalmost never told by scholars precisely because the myth of the vanishing race has been so pervasivethat coll thrush brilliantly narrates in his remarkable and beautifully writ ten book native seattle histories from the crossingover place begin ning with the observation that few cities in the united states have placed greater emphasis on their native heritage than seattle he then points to the subtle and tragic processes that gradually marginalized and obscured indian people residing in that city even as totem poles and northwest coast indian artworks were coming to symbolize seattle special regional identity native inhabitants were being assigned their traditional roles in the narrative of the vanishing race as poignant icons of a lost past as images of timeless beauty but not as living residents in a city where so many streets and sites bear indian names and where as thrush wryly notes totem poles until only recently outnumbered cell phone towers it has been all too easy for nonindian inhabitants and visitors to miss the fact that thousands of native people still live within the boundaries of the city one strand of thrushs narrative then is a series of ghost stories tales of how seattle became a city haunted with evocative images of its native past among its many indian ghosts none has played a more prominent role than chief seattle himself or seeathl as this book prefers to call him as a reminder of his actual historical identity chief seattle f o r e w o r d i x mark fogarty stats say big apple has most urban indians indian country today february online at httpwwwindiancountrycomcontentcfmid is associated with what is arguably the single most famous piece of indian oratory in all of american history a text that most americans have encountered many times without giving much thought to its ori gins or authenticity both of which are murky at best its closing lines explicitly describe cities like seattle as places still perennially visited by the shades of departed peoples who still hold them dear at night when the streets of your cities and villages will be silent and you think them deserted they will throng with returning hosts that once filled and still love this beautiful land the white man will never be alone let him be just and deal kindly with my people for the dead are not powerless deaddid i say there is no death only a change of worlds it is hard not to be moved by the poetry of these lines see pp which no doubt accounts for the frequency with which they are quotedand yet it would also be hard to imagine a passage that more unambiguously affirms the myth of the vanishing race that is why it is so unsurpris ing to learn that we have no real authority for believing that chief seat tle actually spoke these words or that he so easily imagined a future time when his stillliving people had ceased to dwell in their homeland this then leads to the second major theme of coll thrushs book tacking back and forth between myth and reality he painstakingly demonstrates the ongoing presence of duwamish suquamish and other native residents of seattle who have always been present always part of its history even as the myth was doing its work of reinventing a supposedly vanished indian landscape to fit the frontier and regional narrative of the emerging city on the shore of puget sound in so doing he effectively turns the myth on its head by showing how intimately seattle native residents were involved in every stage of the city his torical evolution far from vanishing they were present at the creation they continued to make essential contributions as the city grew to met ropolitan status and they persisted in maintaining their special rela tionships with the local landscape right down to the present over and over again thrush discovers a geography of native use and native dwelling that the modern citycape obscures without quite eliminat x ing altogether some places in this intricate web of native relationships with the local environment eventually came to be highlighted in the imagined geography of modern seattle while others found no place in that geography among its many accomplishments native seattle offers quiet but irresistible proof that any full understanding of the city history must incorporate all aspects of native history and geography not just the ones selectively celebrated by the myth of the vanishing race the result is a history with implications far beyond seattle no other book does what this one does in a world where many modern people too easily lose track of the natural ecosystems they inhabit preferring instead to seek out nature in remote corners of the globe it is useful to be reminded that even a great city has a long history of human habi tation that is intimately and inextricably bound to the local lands and waters and creatures that help define such places by seeking out the myriad ways that seattle native peoples related to the world around them thrush offers modern city dwellers an unexpectedly powerful way of seeing aspects of the urban landscape that might otherwise be entirely invisible to them and by showing readers how human beings in the past have related to the local ecosystems even of great metro politan areas in profoundly different ways he reminds us not to be taken in by the seductive but alltooselective appeals of our mythic imagi nations just as seattle native peoples have never vanished from the city neither have the geographiesnatural and historical and imagined that made those people native to this place by helping us see the mod ern city at least a little through the eyes of people whose presence might otherwise be too easy to ignore coll thrush invites us to revisit the his tories and geographies of our own home places as well f o r e w o r d x i terra miscognita i n the words of one descendant of the denny party as seat tles founders are typically called the story of the city origin is an ofttold tale yet is ever new indeed in the century and a half since the landing of arthur denny and his compatriots on the beach at alki point on november seattle creation story has been reduced reused recycled and reenacted in books plays speeches and art often the telling of the story says more about the moment of the telling than about the event itself we will encounter many such recount ings throughout seattle native histories the basic story however has remained the same seattle historian murray morgan captured the scene best in his history from the bottom up skid road in this peren nially popular tale of the politics and personalities of seattle first cen tury morgan described the arrival of the twentyfour settlers on a rainy beach three of the four women cried when the brigs boat put them ashore on the saltsmelling beach portland had been rude and the ship awful but this was worse the only habitation was a log cabin still roofless and the only neigh bors a host of bowlegged indians the men wearing only buckskin breech clouts the women skirts of cedar bark the children naked the sky was low and gray the air sharp with salt and iodine the wind cold but soon the women were too busy to weep morgans version of the story has it all the miserable passage on the schooner exact the dismal weather the crying women the unfinished cabin and most importantly the story has indians possibly danger ous certainly alien their presence makes the story all the more dra matic it is in this momentin the tense introduction between two peoplesthat seattle urban history begins and to no small extent it is the moment when according to the standard version of seattle storyline local indian history begins to end seattle creation story is not even really a story at all but rather a snapshot certainly the denny partys overland journey from illinois is part of the backstory but it is really the singularity of the landing at alki point across elliott bay from presentday downtown that is the mythic point of beginning in which longer processes are collapsed into a frozen moment in time in this respect seattle creation story is like many others in a essay about evolution and baseball for exam ple natural historian stephen jay gould argued that stories about begin nings come in only two basic modes an entity either has an explicit point of origin a specific time and place of creation or else it evolves and has no definable moment of entry into the world in his account of the differences between the sports gradual evolution from a plethora of previous stickandball games and the more mythic story of coopers town gould noted that we seem to prefer the model of origin by a moment of creationfor then we can have heroes and sacred places the same is true for american history more broadly we love our mayflowers lexingtons and fort sumters they are discrete moments chosen out of the complexity of the past and designated as the place where one thing is said to end and another to begin in seattle where the heroes are the denny party and the sacred place is alki point that snapshot in place and time has literally been turned into a shrine of sorts at the museum of history and industry the city official repository of its past a diorama displays the events of that blus tery november day comprising wax figures handmade miniature cloth ing shellacked greenery and a painted beachscape backdrop the diorama was created in by local doll maker lillian smart to com memorate seattle recent centenary and to celebrate the museums open ing it includes all the stock characters and props of the city founding myth a roofless cabin at the forests edge tiny handkerchiefs lifted to wax faces and childrens heads turned warily toward chief seattle and a few other indian men the tableau made manifest the story that seat tle residents had already been telling themselves for decades and within a few months of the dioramas unveiling its sponsorsthe alki womens improvement club and the west seattle business associationclaimed that thousands of seattle residents tourists and school children have stood in front of it admiring its beauty and realism and paying silent homage to seattle founders for more than two generations of seat tleites visiting the diorama has been a kind of urban pilgrimage still on display at the beginning of the twentyfirst century smarts power ful visual distillation of the city creation story is the image that most likely comes to many local residents minds when they think of seat tles founding not unlike baseballs creation story or the origin myth of the nation itself with its providential pilgrims landing in that single sacred moment at the place they named plymouth seattle creation story is also one of predestination for all the drama of crying women threat ening skies and strange indians seattle future seems a done deal civic booster and local historian welford beaton for example reiter ated the title of his book the city that made itself by claiming that seat tle started deliberately nearby titles on any local library shelf express the same sense of nascent destiny of future greatness born in those first moments at alki outdoing beaton mayor george cotterills cli max of a world quest reads seattle twentiethcentury future back onto the voyages of explorers like vancouver cook and even magellan in local mythology the arrival of seattle pilgrims is deliberate planned and preordained sprung like athena from the collective forehead of arthur denny and the other members of his party as for the indige nous people encountered in the creation moment at alki point their future was also foretold written in disease and dispossession the pow erful story of the vanishing red man as we shall see both informed the denny partys journey to puget sound in the first place and has informed the telling of their landing at alki ever since it is one of the foundational pillars of seattle standard civic narrative in which one kind of history indian begins to decline the moment another history urban starts its ascent but beginnings and endings are rarely clear in history and the events t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta that we call history were rarely as deliberate or discrete as we imagine them to be from our vantage point in the present like most creation stories whether of a sport or of a nation seattle origin myth obscures more about actual historical events than it reveals first it renders invis ible a complex local indigenous landscape of stories reaching back to the ice age of villages made wealthy by river and prairie and tideflat and of numinous forces beyond human understanding second by com pressing the landing of into a single moment it ignores earlier processes of empire and ecology that set the stage for city making on puget sound third it obscures the ambitions and imaginations of the denny party themselves ascribing to them motivations and knowledge that are more ours than theirs finally it sets urban founders and indige nous peopleand through them urban and indian historyin oppo sition as seemingly alien to each other as the two groups that met on the beach that november in but if we widen our view beyond that one day of that one year on that one beach seattle creation story takes on a very different form looking more like goulds blurry account of baseballs actual evolu tion rather than a single moment of creation in this version of the story urban founding on puget sound becomes a complex contingent process in which indigenous worlds are misapprehended empires vie for dominance and future city fathers change their minds and make mistakes and most importantly in this other kind of creation story indigenous people and places are at the center of the telling and have everything to do with getting to the place called seattle well before the city mythic moment of birth seattle urban and indian histories were already being bound together in a landscape rich with contested mean ings and possibilities b efore the arrival of the exact and the denny party perhaps in the s a young man named wahalchoo was hunting sea ducks off a promontory of open grassy spaces among windstunted trees known to him as prairie point he was looking for more than scoters and scaups wahalchoo had been fasting and was also in search of spirit power he found it there near prairie point if only briefly while retrieving spent arrows he spied a vast longhouse deep in the green waters surrounded by herds of elk and with schools of salmon swimming over its cedarplank roof this wahalchoo knew was the home of a power that brought wealth gen erosity and respect to those who carried it with its help wahalchoo could become a great leader he went home to find his father who could help him obtain the power but the older man was away and when wahalchoo returned to prairie point the waters were clear but empty the longhouse beneath the waves had disappeared and wahal choo was left to seek power elsewhere indigenous people like wahalchoo who would some twentyfive years later make his mark on a treaty under the christian name jacob moved through landscapes that were dense with meaning the proof is in the names prairie point which would become alki point in was but one named place on a peninsula bordered on the west and north by deep salt water and on the east by a meandering river and its estu ary the headland that brooded to the east of prairie point was low point while to the south along the outer shore a creek called capsized came pouring out of the forest near a place called rids the cold south of there were headlands called tight bluff and place of scorched bluff together these placenames map the indigenous landscape open places among the forest cliffs tightly crowded with brush or blackened by mineral deposits they are also the closest things we have to photographs of the preurban world by the time landscape photographers arrived in seat tle most of these places had been utterly transformed but photographs like dioramas are static and the world around prairie point was not thrust out into the currents and storm paths of puget sound the points sand and stone were built up in one season then swept away in another before the seawalls and bulkheads of the modern era the promontory constantly shifted sometimes subtly and at other times abruptly similarly the indigenous landscapes of what would come to be known as puget sound country were changing long before the arrival of the denny party in some of these changes were slow others catastrophic as prairie point snagged overlapping nets of power knowledge and ecology over the course of centuries when t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta arthur denny and the rest came to alki point which they called new york they intruded upon a world already in the midst of profound changes new networks of trade imperial reconnaissance and most important of all epidemic disease each served as preludes to the founding of an american city the first written records of the lands and waters around the future seattle come from when british explorer george vancouver and his crew sailed into the inland sea aboard the discovery like most euro pean explorers vancouver spent little time trying to ascertain indige nous peoples own knowledge of their world his journals contain few native words and say little of the regions indigenous geography instead they are filled with names like whidbey and rainier they are examples of what geographer daniel w clayton has called imperial fashioning in which indigenous places were reinscribed with euro pean nomenclature and incorporated into the colonial geographies of european nationstates even the name for the sea itselfgiven in honor of vancouvers subordinate peter puget who had diligently surveyed so much of ittransformed the inland sea whose indigenous name sim ply meant salt water into a british waterway with an anglonorman pedigree it transformed the undifferentiated space of terra incognita into place or space with a history emptying it of its indigenous history at least on official mapsand making it part of a north america lit tered with historical references to european people and places this was also one of seattle first kinds of urban history in its linking of indige nous places like puget sound to imperial centers such as london but underneath this refashioned landscape lay another geography for vir tually every imperial puget there was an indigenous counterpart even if vancouver and his men simply could not or would not see it it was less terra incognita than it was terra miscognita for the terra here already included an urban history of its own when wahalchoo returned home for help in obtaining wealth and power he went not to some hovel in the wilderness but to a proud village called place of clear water with a great cedar longhouse that was one of the largest indigenous structures in north america not far away just around low point from the place where wahalchoo had gone diving for power was another settlement herrings house made up of several longhouses and a larger house used for winter ceremonies neither settlement was just a village a term that may connote primitiveness and transience instead these were places where elite families coordinated social alliances religious observances and resource distribution although not large in terms of populationboth herrings house and place of clear water likely had only several scores of residents eachthey and other indigenous winter settlements functioned as towns in relation ship to their territories natural resources political power and spiri tual force circulated through these settlements in ways reminiscent of the networks enmeshing larger urban places in other parts of the world captain vancouvers london included each of these winter towns along with nearby seasonal camps resource sites and sacred places was linked into a broader geographic community through webs of kinship trade and diplomacy through out puget sound these larger communities many of which would become known as tribes through relations with the american federal government in the nineteenth century were typically organized around watersheds and there were three such groups in the territories that would someday become seattle herrings house for example was part of a larger constellation of communities whose members called them selves the people of the inside place after the location of their main settlements inland from the sound their name for themselves would be anglicized as duwamish a second group known as the hachoo absh or lake people and usually described as a band of the duwamish lived in towns ringing a vast deep lake behind the hills fronting puget sound a third group with connections to the first two as well as to the people of place of clear water who are now known as the suquamish was the shilshoolabsh the people of tucked away inside who took their name from their main settlement on the tidal inlet that the amer icans would call salmon bay these three indigenous communities the duwamish the lakes and the shilsholeseach had their own towns with names like place of the fish spear and little canoe chan nel and each town in turn had its own hinterland of prairies and ceme teries fish camps and hunting grounds these local geographies were t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta themselves connected through trade and kinship to communities as far away as the arid interior plateau of the columbia river and the coast of vancouver island knitting the entire region together in a compli cated indigenous weave of towns and territories when discovery came into salt water in june of that weave was already fraying with few exceptions puget sound country seemed nearly destitute of human beings to the englishmen vancouver wrote that animated nature seemed nearly exhausted and her awful silence was only now and then interrupted by the croaking of a raven the breath ing of a seal or the scream of an eagle after several encounters with native people one reason for the silence became clear smallpox this deplorable disease vancouver wrote is not only common but it is greatly to be apprehended is very fatal among them as its indelible marks were seen on many blind eyes pockmarked skin and other ravages familiar to any urban european were clear evidence that the scourge of variola had visited the local people and indeed at least one major epi demic had already swept through the region likely extrapolating from his own experiences in the great cities of europe vancouver imagined what had been lost as his expedition came upon the remains of native communities where since their abdication or extermination nothing but the smaller shrubs and plants had yet been able to rear their heads vancouver and other europeans tended to see indigenous north amer icans as people without history but the evidence of that history in the form of fallenin roofs and prairies unburned by their cultivators and reverting to forest was everywhere dramatic changes like those caused by comes out all over as small pox was known in the local language were nothing new to the indige nous people of pugets sound their ancestors had arrived some ten millennia earlier just as vast glaciers were retreating from the region and their creation stories describe a chaotic postice age world where rivers flowed in both directions the earth shifted and brutal cold harassed the people until dookweebathl the changer brought order to things it would take millennia for the climate to stabilize and for salmon and cedar the two most important benefactors of later indige nous life to colonize the region while volcanic eruptions massive earth quakes and catastrophic mudflows routinely punctuated native history with episodes of devastation for the hierarchical societies living on the shores of salt water change produced anxiety the word dookw to change or transform is the root for a host of concepts including worry dissatisfaction anger infirmity and ferocity at the same time it is also the root of the words for yesterday and tomorrowan indication that change was a constant in indigenous life before the arrival of euro peans and that the people without history were people with a past few of these changes however had consequences as dramatic wide spread and permanent as the introduction of smallpox and other dis eases into the local ecology the microbial intrusion followed not long after by that of vancouver and his crew presagedindeed facilitated the coming of an even greater change the settlement of the country by people of european descent the voyage of the discovery had little direct impact on the people of salt water but in places like london and boston and washington vancouvers accounts inspired ambitious brit ons and americans to establish a permanent presence in the region encouraged by accounts of a dwindling indigenous population the first americans came in when the united states exploring expedition led by lieutenant charles wilkes sailed up the sound the ex ex as the expedition was known was among other things tasked with strengthening american claims to lands north of the columbia river still held jointly by britain and the united states not surprisingly the mission included naming as the crews of wilkess sloop of war vin cennes and its attendant brig porpoise carefully mapped the bays and inlets they added a new set of names to puget sounds growing impe rial geography that summer prairie point obtained its first english language name when it was christened point roberts after the ex exs physician like vancouver wilkes found that the landscapes of puget sound savoured of civilization as for the indigenous residents their appar ently small numbers suggested that the indians of puget sound as they had been named were unlikely to stand in the way of white set tlement and even if they did new waves of disease were rapidly thin ning them off the real threat for wilkes and for the congress that t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta sent him came not from indigenous people but from the british who were establishing a yearround presence at fort nisqually on the south ern sound as facilitators of the highly dynamic fur trade fort nis quallys hudsons bay company factors were always looking for new places to build and for a short time prairie point was a candidate for one of these outlying bastions of mercantile capitalism an sur vey by fort nisqually physician william tolmie provided the first writ ten description of the point flat and dotted with small pines and the soil mostly sand and the first mentions of its surrounding envi rons and the tuomish indians who he noted were miserably poor and destitute of firearms but despite the apparent friendliness of the local peoplesome surely led by seeathlit was a bad place for an out post with poor soil and no freshwater with the signing of a treaty between britain and the united states in the issue became moot british influence at fort nisqually faded although the forts presence continued to have farreaching consequences during an outbreak of dysentery and measles in the winter of native people from all over puget sound including the territories in and around the future seattle traded there and took the microbes home with them despite wave after wave of diseaseat least five separate epidemics by indigenous people remained the dominant presence around salt water as samuel hancock one of the first american settlers on puget sound learned when he stopped at prairie point in a great many indians came from their houses to the beach here to ascertain where we came from he wrote adding that they seemed well disposed toward him hancock traded with the people exchanging tobacco and looking glasses for clams and salmon although buffeted by strength ening storms of change during the early nineteenth century symbol ized by new placenames new diseases and new things to buy and sell prairie point was still very much an indigenous place when hancock visited the place where the exact would drop anchor two years later was still more salt water than puget sound nothing illustrates this more than the word hancock used to describe the growing number of white settlers in the region he called them whulgers using the indigenous word for salt water to describe those who thought they were coming to pugets sound w hile arthur denny is unanimously credited with being the father of seattle that title could just as easily go to a forgotten figure named george brock a resident of the willamette valley at the western end of the oregon trail brock appears only briefly not unlike one of shake speares plotdriving apparitions in the story of the denny partys jour ney west when the denny and boren families arrived at the confluence of the burnt and snake rivers brock was there and in the shadow of bunchgrasscovered hills blackened by summer wildfires he warned arthur denny that the best willamette land was already spoken for but that another region ideal for settlement lay just to the north in his mem oirs denny recalled that his attention was thus turned to the sound and i formed the purpose of looking in that direction brocks bit of rumor and speculationhe apparently had never seen puget sound effectively and suddenly diverted the two illinois families as they labored up the difficult burnt river canyon toward the columbia they were now on their way not to the oakdotted prairies of the willamette but to the timbershadowed shores of salt water but if arthur denny seems to have been easily swayed by the shad owy brock his group did not rush headlong into unknown territory instead their tentative incremental steps toward settlement reflect the cautious mindful demeanor for which seattle founders were renowned in september as family members lay bedridden with fever in portland hotel rooms arthur denny interviewed thomas cham bers a puget sound settler in town on business chambers provided denny with his first firsthand account of the territory to the north includ ing the indigenous inhabitants who he said were friendly and they were glad to have the bostonsas they called the americansto come chamberss testimony cemented dennys intentions to lead the group to the sound meanwhile arthurs brother david and new compatriot john low headed to olympia a tiny settlement built around tideflats t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta at the head of the sound there they met two men who would make the landing at alki point possible leander terry who was also look ing to settle on the inland sea and captain robert fay a retired whal ing captain who wanted to hire local indians to catch salmon preserve it at point roberts and load it onto ships bound for san francisco fay offered denny low and terry seats in his open scow and on sep tember the four men came ashore just inside low point around the headland from where wahalchoo had dived for power years before there they found scores of indians waiting among them was the head man who had agreed to procure indigenous workers for the venture seeathl his business arrangements complete fay left terry denny and low to explore the area land reconnaissance was largely out of the ques tion thanks to a bewildering landscape of tideflats salt marshes and dense forest so after hiring two indigenous men from the camp to serve as guides the three americans headed up the duwamish river by canoe had low terry or denny been able to converse with their guides in whul shootseed instead of a crude combination of hand signs and chinook jargon they might have learned the ancient and practical names of land marks on the river shortcuts trailheads backwaters they might have learned the names for the rivers abundance salmondrying frames duck nets stretched between tall poles fine carving wood their guides might not however have told them of the numinous places along the river and its delta a boulder carved with shamanic power spirits the home of a malevolent spirit that took the form of a fingerless hand rising from the water the ruins of an ancient fish weir dating to the time of the changer more than just a resource territory the valley of the duwamish was also a place rich with stories and powers but the guides apparently shared none of this knowledge with their charges and even if they had they would likely have been misunderstood this was not only because of the vast differences between english and whulshootseed but because the settlers and their guides also spoke two mutually unintelligible lan guages of landscape where indigenous people saw spirits and nets and carving woodthe wealth of the land as it was and had beendenny and the others saw the wealth of the land as it could and would be expressed in words like arable improvement and export and so after their reconnaissance was complete david denny penned a note to his brother decreeing that the valley of the duwamish had room enough for one thousand travelers the decision to found a city had been made and low caught captain fays next scow back to olympia on his way to portland with the news if any moment must be named as the birth of seattle then surely this was it in fact though some of those thousand travelers had already arrived and they and their indigenous neighbors helped prepare the way for the rest of the denny party a month before denny low and terry arrived at seeathls fishing camp luther collins henry van asselt and jacob and samuel mapel had joined some seven hundred indians camped at low point before setting out to stake claims in the valley of the duwamish while denny and terry set to building a cabin with native workers paid in bread for their assistance local indians and whites made their presence known on one day for example collins and a native man known as nisqually john drove a team of oxen past on the beach on another old duwampsh curley and several other indians came to visit offering denny and terry a meal of roast duck not long after terry hitched a ride to olympia in collinss scow to gather the rest of the party in portland david denny was left alone to continue work on a cabin for his family and their cohort when the thousandtravelers note arrived in portland arthur denny and the rest of his party healed from their bouts of ague and joined by the bell family from indiana booked passage on a twomasted schooner called the exact on november they left portland crossed the colum bias murderous bar and headed north along the coast along with the families bound for david dennys cabin at alki the exact carried other settlers hoping to establish homes on puget sound and miners many straight from the california goldfields on their way to the queen char lotte islands far to the north more than a week later on november the twentyfour pilgrims made landfall at prairie point and were greeted by a very grateful david denny who was suffering mightily from a fresh axe wound on his foot then came the famed moment of creation the crying the rain the anxious meeting with seeathl and his people t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta the date may be the same but the historical circumstances of this urban founding bear few similarities to the singular deliberate and pre ordained landing described in seattle traditional creation story instead the story of the denny partys arrival at alki point is one of rumors and abrupt changes in plans of illness and accidents of native towns and other settlers who got there first most importantly the story has active indian players the labor contractor seeathl the guides who took the first members of the denny party up the river even nisqually john and old duwampsh curley their presence and agency set the story not in an emptiedout wilderness but in a still densely populated indigenous world the process of getting to alkiof founding an american city on salt waterhad depended in no small part upon indigenous people and places the process of getting along at alki would as well this would prove to be the greatest mistake made in apprehending the topography of terra miscognita the idea that founding a city could take place without the presenceindeed the toleranceof indigenous people w hen the denny party landed at the point they called it neither prairie point nor seattle instead the tiny american outpost was christened new york over time it would come to be known as new yorkalki a moniker meaning new york byandby or new york eventually in the local lingua franca of chinook jargon in the middle of the nine teenth century the metropolis at the mouth of the hudson river was the ne plus ultra of american aspiration the model to which new cities on the nations urban frontier aspired it was the commercial capital of the nation and reached out with steamers railways newspapers and retail houses into the rapidly expanding antebellum nation more than simply the economic center of the country though new york was also its cultural hearth while some critics had begun to describe new york as a wicked city it was more commonly lauded as the driver of american progress its success the result of a refined cultured urban environment that stimulated the nations intellectual and social devel opment the founders might have chosen a different name for their hopeful settlement just three or four decades later after waves of immi gration expos√©s of urban violence and new attitudes about the per ils of modern urban life had changed the meaning of new york but to a tiny clutch of families in a halffinished cabin on a puget sound beach in gotham must have seemed the apotheosis of urban ambition leander terry and his younger brother charles were from upstate new york and had likely had firsthand experiences with americas pre mier city but for the majority of seattle founders the frontier towns of illinois shaped their vision for puget sounds new york in ways a distant gotham never could have in when the denny and boren families left home for oregon knox county illinois was in the midst of an urban revolution permanent white settlement in the area had begun only in the s but by midcentury the forests of sugar maple basswood and wild cherry were giving way as families headed by men with stolid biblical names like israel and azel and hiram established farms and feedlots life on the farms revolved around the young town of abingdon whose limestone buildings and prim grid of streets sat on high rolling ground above a tributary of the spoon river town life in abingdon a satellite of st louis was orderly liquor violations morals charges and murders were virtually unheard of and judges handed out one hundred percent conviction rates for such disorderly acts as wantonly burning prairies we might ask if it was the fire itself or the wantonness with which it was lit that was so criminal court days were a primary form of entertainment in this straitlaced town and the cherry grove seminary founded by cumberland presbyterians was the dominant cultural institution it was from this buttonedup protes tant world that seattle pilgrims came but if knox county seems to us almost stereotypically midwestern it was in fact part of the old northwest and its orderliness and peace stood on foundations of chaos and war in abingdon was on st louiss urban periphery but only twenty years earlier it had been at the edge of the pays den haut a vast region crisscrossed by trade networks these networks along which furs and other commodities made their way reached between the centers of european and asian society and t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta indigenous communities like those of the coiracoentanon who lived along the banks of what they called the amaquonsippi and what amer icans would call the spoon by the eighteenth century what had been a middle ground of accommodation had become what historian richard white has called a world of fragments as european empires and indigenous nations vied for power the violence of the period led many coiracoentanon to leave the valley of the amaquonsippi for refugee settlements to the south the last local conflict known as the black hawk war saw the end of indigenous tenure in what could then become knox county with treaties only a quarter century old nullified by war the surviving coirancoentanon had by disappeared for ever from this locality according to one early writer with none of the whites knowing when or where they went the result was that the dennys and other settlers of s knox county had very little contact with native people although evidence of the indigenous past lay all around them settlers regularly came across earthen mounds flint arrowheads and the ruins of wigwams as they plowed and felled indians also remained part of local memory in accounts of war social power in knox county typically sprang out of the black hawk war whose veterans and organizers translated their military lead ership into civilian political careers and so the foundations of abing dons new urban order actually lay in chaos and violence the lows from nearby bloomington illinois and the bells from more distant edwardsville indiana had all likely had similar experiences in amer ican towns built in the former pays den haut william bells father for example had been a ranger during the wars of american expansion the denny party brought with them both visions of urban order and perhaps resigned expectations of war with a doomed race and very little firsthand experience with native people on puget sound those visions and expectations collided with the realities of settling in puget sound they collided first with the fact that indian people were not about to disappear with the arrival of the urban frontier and second with the dawning reality that while war was always a possibility for the most part indigenous people were plan ning to participate in the creation of that frontier founding a city in the pacific northwest meant living alongside native men women and children almost immediately after the exact put the settlers ashore for example indians came to live with them arthur denny recalled the scene soon after we landed and began clearing the ground for our buildings they commenced to congregate and continued coming until we had over a thousand in our midst and most of them remained all winter some of them built their houses very near to ours even on the ground we had cleared and although they seemed very friendly toward us we did not feel safe in objecting to their building thus near to us for fear of offending them and it was very noticeable that they regarded their proximity to us as a pro tection against other indians dennys account paints a radically different picture from lillian smarts creation story diorama instead of twentyfour settlers on an empty beach with perhaps a handful of indians on hand we see those same twentyfour whites as pale faces among hundreds of darker ones dennys account also speaks to the reasons native people came to new yorkalkiout of curiosity to trade or in fear of increasingly com mon raids from northern indians regardless of the reasons by a few weeks after the founding new yorkalki was no longer just an amer ican settlement it was also an indigenous one arthur denny and the others should not have been surprised although they had had only one direct interaction with indians on the overland journey a furtive skirmish with some shoshoni men on the snake river other experiences farther west made it clear that city found ing in the northwest would include indians the early growth of port land for example quite a thriving town even at that early period in arthur dennys own words was fueled largely by its new sawmill when the mill opened in on the bank of the willamette local indige nous people established a new settlement adjacent to it within weeks where they made up a significant portion of portlands population and the mills labor force similarly the embryo city of olympia at the head of puget sound consisted of about a dozen onestory frame cabins t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta covered with split cedar siding wellventilated and healthy and perhaps twice as many indian huts near the custom house when david denny and john low met lee terry there within a few weeks of its founding new yorkalki looked much the same it was a biracial place to use the language of the day it was a place of bostons and siwashes the former a reference to the city of origin of many of the first americans on puget sound and the latter a derogatory term derived from the french word sauvage with little expe rience other than tales of war the settlers were forced to amend their ambitions in light of their new and seemingly precarious circumstances likewise indigenous people who had left for prairie point but who had arrived in new yorkalki had to come to terms with the new rules of engagement represented by white settlement facing each other across linguistic and cultural chasms the indigenous and white residents of prairie pointnew yorkalki mystified each other native practices were often inexplicable to the settlers despite complaints from one of the settler wives for example one elderly indigenous woman insisted on throwing her used tea leaves at table legs whenever she visited the cab ins meanwhile settler children caught herding garter snakes into a brush fire were sharply admonished by indian neighbors who said it would bring a flood soon after according to a denny descendants own account there was in fact a downpour indigenous men and women found the newcomers and in particular the boston women equally strange they crowded into the crude cabins to watch the women cook and clean several memoirs tell of mary denny and lydia low enlist ing harsh words or a hot skillet to maintain some semblance of privacy during those first few weeks americans and indians each made attempts to reach across divides of language belief and etiquette sometimes it worked when some laundry disappeared soon after the setters arrived arthur denny spoke to seeathl who admonished the other indians present and oversaw the swift return of the missing garments on another occasion one of the white women fed a sick indigenous child whose father a hard case dubbed old alki john gave her a tin pail in return although she refused his giftmore likely an actual payment and her refusal thus a minor affront to native ideals of reciprocitythe two families had nonetheless established a bond also during that first winter a woman named ooyathl one of the wives of seeathl died suddenly david and arthur denny built a cedar coffin for her body which was wrapped in so many blankets that it would not go in helping give ooyathl the highclass burial her status demanded helps explain the close connections between the denny fam ilies and the families of seeathl in decades to come with david denny a particular favorite of many native people in and around seattle but attempts at accommodation did not mean there were no tensions the male members of denny party in particular saw themselves as the intellectual and moral leaders of new yorkalki no matter the num ber of their indigenous neighbors during that first winter they made it clear that a new political order with them at the top was emerging at prairie point when a very white indian woman named seeayay came to the settlement to escape an abusive husband on the puyallup river to the south david denny advocated on her behalf she later married the son of old alki john just plain alki john and as a result david denny became known as the lawman among local indigenous com munities meanwhile when an altercation between indians visiting from the green river and the cascade foothills threatened to turn violent arthur denny stepped in and kept them apart until tempers died down while the indigenous disputants likely saw him as an impartial out side moderator in keeping with local legal tradition denny surely inter preted their acquiescence as a sign that the indians sought orderin particular his order other performances of white authority were less subtle when the vincennes the same ship that had been part of wilkess expedition arrived at new yorkalki during that first winter it repeatedly fired cannon that had once been used in a massacre in the south pacific the booming reports made a strong and respectful impression upon the hundreds of indians while to the settlers notic ing the effect upon the indians it was music of a delightful character during the same months that an american minority learned to live among an indigenous majority that minority made it clear who planned to be in charge in the years ahead at the same time indigenous people exerted their own influences t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta over the urban beginnings of new yorkalki when the brig leonesa arrived exchanging staples like flour and sugar for wooden piles to help build san francisco it was native men who cut most of the trees and floated the lumber out to the ship indians also brought bushel after bushel of potatoes to the settlement as supplies ran low during the win ter gathering them from gardens in their own towns and just as the name new york was followed by a chinook jargon suffix the first com mercial venture in the settlement set up by john low and charles terry in november had a name drawn from the hybrid trade language the new york markook house markook or makook meaning trade kept constantly on hand and for sale at the lowest prices all kinds of mer chandise usually required in a new country indeed new yorkalki was a new country for native and settler alike d espite the symbolism of events like ooyathls burial and the firing of the ships cannon both intended to make lasting if conflicting impressions upon local indians the found ing of new yorkalki does not register prominently in the oral tradition of local native peoples in fact it does not register at all among the many indigenous accounts of nineteenthcentury history in central puget sound there are virtually no stories about the denny party and the little settlement on the point clearly what is so impor tant to seattle civic placestory is much less so in indian country per haps the landing at alki was just one more arrival of settlers during a period when similar foundings were taking place on the shores of salt water perhaps it is overshadowed by other events of the s the treaties and the resulting conflict that settlers would name an indian war and of course not all stories survive nor do their keepers but perhaps the most obvious reason that the alki landing is not part of local indigenous oral tradition is because the settlement of new yorkalki was a temporary arrangement and so in the late winter of arthur denny carson boren and william bell set out to cir cumnavigate elliott bay in search of a permanent location for their home steads since selling piles and timbers to passing ships was the only dependence for support in the beginning as far as denny could see it was important to look well to the facilities for the business the new site had to meet four requirements a deep harbor a supply of freshwater fine stands of timber close to the shore and feed for stock as the three men explored the shores of elliott bay they circulated through another arc of the landscape but the indigenous places around elliott bay were largely invisiblesave one one denny descendant described their arrival at the spot using modern landmarks to orient her readers in the afternoon as they paddled south the explorers discovered that the high bluff gradually dropped from a height of forty feet to the level of a little tide stream with meadow grass on its banks which we know as yesler way north of this was a knoll at the foot of cherry street south of the stream was a low wooded section and half hidden therein were the ruins of an indian hut the distinct shore line ended rather abruptly and merged into tide flats at what is now the foot of king street making a point at low tide and an island at high tide the three men decided that this place known as little crossingover place to seeathl and his people because of a trail leading into the back country was to be their new home soon it would become seattle on may plats for the town of seattle were officially filed by then the settlement had grown into a small hamlet including figures like henry yesler and david doc maynard who would become key players in seattle urban drama although the whulshootseed name for the site was now familiar to many of the settlers the awkward and meaningless word meaning little crossingover place was never considered as a name for the town while duwamps and duwamish river two other options used briefly during were considered ugly and unflattering instead the community leaders chose to name their town after seeathl who had played such a vital role in life at new yorkalki historians have debated seeathls reac tion to this some say that he was indifferent others that he was horrified by the decision and even went to olympia to protest it and still more suggest that he may have given the name willingly as he approached t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta the end of his life regardless of what he thought the naming of seat tle is typically portrayed in civic historiography as a critical turning point a handing over from the indigenous to the urban indeed well before the day when bell boren and denny decided that little crossingover place would be their new home the indige nous world of the duwamish lakes and shilsholes had been irrevo cably transformed the ruined longhouse at little crossingover place overgrown with wild roses and according to oral tradition only one of several that had once stood there spoke to the abandonment of towns in the wake of epidemics and slave raids in whulshootseed similar words described both houses and human bodies house posts were limbs roof beams were spines walls were skin just as sweeping a house and healing a body could be expressed with the same verb related words spoke of illness and the falling down of a home and so the ruins were testaments to loss meanwhile on a nearby bluff above elliott bay at what is now spring street a cemetery adorned with tin and trade beads spoke of the epidemics and the traders who had brought them read like a text the landscape seemed to tell of the passing of indians from puget sound and so the naming of seattle seems the end of an era but of course the story is much more complicated than that when the plat for seattle was filed in may it showed a grid of straight lines not unlike the layout of abingdon or one of the other towns from which the bostons had come on the ground however the landscape would not be easily transformed into a model of cartesian harmony arthur denny could attest to that the front of our territory was so rough and broken as to render it almost uninhabitable at that early time he recalled i dug a well forty feet deep in the bottom of the gulch and only got quick sand with a very limited amount of water direct com munication with the bay by which we received all our supplies at that time was next to impossible owing to the height of the bluff terra miscognita in the form of gullies and springs sand and slopes would exert its own agency over seattle growth forcing urban visions to accom modate local realities so would the people of little crossingover place and herrings house and clear water and all the other native towns just as vancouvers puget sound had not erased salt water just as wilkess point roberts and the denny partys new yorkalki had only partially obscured prairie point seattle would not entirely replace little crossingover place in naming settlements like seattle europeans and americans sought to claim them and turn the abstract spaces of wilderness into placesinto home but such efforts were never completely successful instead the daytoday realities of settlers and natives meant that the newcomers would have to contend with the people and places they sought to replace rather than being emptied of their meanings places in and around the young town would collect new meanings as settlers accreted their own expe riences onto sites with existing indigenous histories for seattle that meant that the coming years would be a time of gatheringof new stories about place about race and about the boundaries between coop eration and conflict seattle urban indian history was just beginning t e r r a m i s c o g n i ta the haunted city e very american city is built on indian land but few adver tise it like seattle go walking in the city and you will see native american images everywhere in the urban landscape wolf and wild man stalk the public spaces of downtown in the form of totem poles tlingit orca totems adorn manhole covers and a bronze indian chieftain raises a welcoming hand as the monorail hums past street musicians protestors and holiday shoppers move across a plaza paved with bricks laid in the pattern of a cedarbark basket souvenir shops hawk dreamcatchers and sweatshirts with totemic frogs while only doors down a highend gallery sells argillite totem poles soap stone walruses and earthquake spirit masks carved by modern mas ters massive car ferries with names like klickitat and elwha slide across puget sound passing an island where since the worlds fair kwak wakawakw performers have welcomed visitors and world leaders to a north coaststyle longhouse out in the neighborhoods schoolchild ren have adorned bus shelters with haida designs of the salmon spirit and coast salish spindle whorls have been soldered into a sewage treat ment stations security gates and then there are the names on the land itself one park named for a red paint used in traditional ceremonies and another for an ancient prairie a marina called shilshole and an industrial waterway known as duwamish the lakefront enclave of leschi named for an executed indigenous leader seattle it seems is a city in love with its native american heritage indeed it is the totem poles motifs of the salmon spirit and fer ries with indian names that tell you where you are without them seat tle would somehow be less seattle every carved image every statue of an indian every indigenous name on the land implies that you are here in this place and not in another they are part of how you know you are not in new york or new orleans london or los angeles they are what we expect from seattle they are stories about place iconic western writer william kittredge has described how stories and places are connected places come to exist in our imaginations because of stories and so do we when we reach for a sense of place we posit an intimate relationship to a set of stories connected to a particular location such as hong kong or the grand canyon or the bed where we were born thinking of histories and the evolution of personalities in a local context having a sense of self means possessing a set of stories about who we are and with whom and why in seattle visitors and residents alike tell and are told stories about this city that it is built on indian land that that land was taken to build a great metropolis and that such a taking is commemorated by the city native american imagery these stories in and of place these place stories define seattle as a city with an indigenous pedigree but seattle is also a haunted city in a metropolis built in indigenous territory and where cellular phone towers only recently outnumbered totem poles it comes as no surprise that seattle has indian ghosts there is the tale of joshua winfield a settler who built his home on an indian cemetery near lake washington only to be frightened into eternity by indigenous revenants one night in the spectral pleas of another indian ghost allegedly that of a murdered native prostitute have been heard since the prohibition era in a rambling victorian home near the duwamish at a nearby golf course a naked indian described as a shaman has been seen since the s dancing at night on what is rumored to be another indigenous burial ground and at pike place market the apparition of an indian woman in a shawl and floorlength skirt has appeared for generations in the windows of the magic shop and in the aisles of the bead store meanwhile members of the local tribes pray for the dead on the banks of the industrial river named for their people and native storytellers lead purification ceremonies in the underground streets and storefronts beneath pioneer square in hopes of bringing peace to wandering indigenous specters by far though the most famous haunting of seattle is accomplished by the city namesake a man called seeathl a local indigenous leader of duwamish and suquamish heritage who facilitated the city found ing seeathl is best known for words he is said to have spoken during treaty discussions in the s when seattle urban promise seemed to require the dispossession of local native peoples your religion was written on tablets of stone by the iron finger of an angry god lest you forget the red man could never comprehend nor remember it our religion is the tradition of our ancestors the dreams of our old men given to them in the solemn hours of the night by the great spirit and the visions of our leaders and it is written in the hearts of our people your dead cease to love you and the land of their nativity as soon as they pass the portals of their tomb they wander far away beyond the stars and are soon forgotten and never return our dead never forget this beautiful world that gave them being they always love its winding rivers its sacred mountains and its sequestered vales and they ever yearn in the tenderest affection over the lonelyhearted living and often return to visit guide and comfort them we will ponder your proposition and when we decide we will tell you but should we accept it i here and now make this the first condition that we will not be denied the privilege without molestation of visiting at will the graves where we have buried our ancestors and our friends and our children every part of this country is sacred to my people every hillside every val ley every plain and grove has been hallowed by some fond memory or some sad experience of my tribe even the rocks which seem to lie dumb as they swelter in the sun along the silent seashore in solemn grandeur thrill with memories of past events connected with the lives of my people and when the last red man shall have perished from the earth and his memory among the white men shall have become a myth these shores will swarm with the invisible dead of my tribe and when your childrens children shall think themselves alone in the fields the store the shop upon the high way or in the silence of the pathless woods they will not be alone in all the earth there is no place dedicated to solitude at night when the streets of your cities and villages will be silent and you t h e h a u n t e d c i t y think them deserted they will throng with returning hosts that once filled and still love this beautiful land the white man will never be alone let him be just and deal kindly with my people for the dead are not powerless dead did i say there is no death only a change of worlds according to seattle times writer eric scigliano the chief seattle speech as it has come to be known is a ghost story like no other it represents not just the words of one man but also the innumerable souls who fished and sang and made art along these shores and had no inkling of cities seeathl gave voice to those wraiths and the city modern residents scigliano warns should tread lightly and treat the land softly you never know who might be watchingfrom above or even nearer but like any good haunting the authenticity of the speech cannot be proven it first appeared in print more than three decades after seeathl put his mark on the treaty of point elliott and it bears a suspicious resem blance to victorian prose lamenting the passing of the red man there is no question that seeathl spoke eloquently at the treaty proceedings he carried thunder which gave skills of oratory as one of his many spirit powersbut his exact words are lost what we do know how ever is that the speech has become a key text of both indigenous rights and environmentalist thinking with some of its adherents going so far as to call it a fifth gospel simultaneously urtext and rorschach test the words of seeathl haunt seattle telling stories of native nobility american colonialism and longing for a lost environmental paradise somewhere between fiction and fact these placestories haunt any his tory of seattle but they often have little to do with the more compli cated story of the real seeathl who died in on a reservation across puget sound from seattle and was buried in a grave bearing his new catholic name noah instead these ghost stories of seeathl have far more to do with the people telling them this is the power of ghost stories of phantoms at the market and the sage wisdom of dead chiefs they tell us more about ourselves and about our time than they tell us about other people or the past in writ ing of the role of ghosts in medieval european society historian jean claude schmitt has claimed that the dead have no existence other than that which the living imagine for them and recent scholarship on amer ican ghosts has shown that hauntings are among the most telling of cultural phenomena expressing powerful anxieties desires and regrets as judith richardson has illustrated in her work on ghosts in new yorks hudson valley hauntings are in fact social memories inspired by rapid cultural and environmental change arising not so much from molder ing graves as from the struggle to create a meaningful history ghosts are also rooted in places perhaps none more so than the ghosts of indi ans in her analysis of hauntings in american literature ren√©e berg land has argued that stories of indian ghosts are also placestories about what happened in particular places and what those happenings meant europeans take possession of native american lands to be sure berg land writes but at the same time native americans take supernatu ral possession of their dispossessors thence springs the resonance of the chief seattle speech which is not easily separated from the wind ing rivers and sequestered vales it mourns it is a story about a place as much as it is a story about a people and it is a story about us in the present as much as it is about historical actors there is also an intimacy to seattle ghost stories among the indige nous people of puget sound the phantasms most feared were those of the recent dead and of kin these sorts of ghosts vexed the living and put them in great danger particularly in the rainy winter months the ghosts of strangers were far less dangerous the greater its entangle ment with the living it was thought the greater a phantoms power and so it is in seattle ghostly history the closer we have lived to each other the more we have been haunted at the same time the problem inherent in seattle indian ghost storiesindeed the central problem of seattle native american historyis that none of these imagined indians was ever real while there may be some kernel of historical truth to some of them for the most part they are historical creations both because they spring out of the city past and because they are ways to make sense of that past the danger in this however is that they all too often tell us exactly what we expected to hear the restless indian dead confirm the city story t h e h a u n t e d c i t y line which is this native history and urban historyand indeed indi ans and citiescannot coexist and one must necessarily be eclipsed by the other the standard story told about seeathl and the city named for him is perhaps the best example of this narrative take for exam ple new york times correspondent tim egans version in his best selling meditation on pacific northwest history and landscape the good rain egan writes of kayaking on elliott bay and pondering the con nections between seeathl and seattle looking back and forth between the modern urban skyline and the site of the indigenous leaders grave across puget sound egan summarizes the story of the man and the city he lived to be a very old man going from aboriginal king of elliott bay and the river that drained into it to a withered curiosity on the muddy streets of what would become the largest city in the country named after a native american to understand seeathl and seattle it seems that this is all you need to know and it tells us what we knew all along that the native past must give way to the urban future the placestory of chief seattle is about the change from one world to another with native history surviving only as a prophetic shadow a disturbing memory an instructive haunting this is not to say that indian people do not exist in the urban present of course they doin the thousands some of them in fact have also become part of the city narrative along with totem poles and seeathl the homeless street indian completes the city trinity of native imagery this third kind of indian placestory however is less often an indict ment of the injustices of the urban political economy than it is a tale about racial inevitability in short stories about native people on seat tles streets are also a kind of ghost story in jack cadys murder mys tery street for example the shapeshifting narrator takes on the form of an aging tlingit seduced south from alaska who dreams of killer whales and talking salmon while in still life with woodpecker tom rob binss heroine princess leighcheri wanders through downtown notic ing that indian winos in particular were unhurried by the weather both robbins and cady conflate street indians with the very atmosphere of the city robbins cloaks his version of seattle in a shamanic rain that whispers like the ecstasy of primitives while cadys city hun kers down under weather systems more gray and ancient than a soli tary old indian meanwhile in hunting mr heartbreak jonathan raban recalls seeing homeless native people sprawled in a brickedover door way in belltown on his first visit to seattle they were like sacks of garbage waiting for collection by the earlymorning truck i tiptoed past them he notes as one walks needlessly quietly in the presence of the dead and so here is the moral of the urban indian story as we think we know it that native people in the city are barely people they are instead shades of the past linked almost mystically to a lost nature cady spells it out directly one of his characters a homeless haidafilipino man named jimmy is described as turning into a ghost right before our eyes thats not a white mans metaphor cadys narrator tells us its an indian fact it is as though the returning hosts those phantoms prophesied in the chief seattle speech have turned out to be nothing more than homeless indians even seattle resident sherman alexie the spokanecoeur dalene indian author rightly lauded for the com plicated humanity of his native characters slides effortlessly into this urban parable in his novel indian killer in which every city was a city of white men racist cops and a serial killer share seattle with a troupe of indians living under the alaskan way viaduct all dampening in that same rain here an occupying force but his hero john smith who may or may not be the murderer scalping white men throughout the city has nothing to fear from the rain he was aboriginal alexie writes he stepped through this rain and fog without incident even in indian killer otherwise a powerful meditation on what it means to be both mod ern and indian cities are somehow places where native people cannot belong except as halffulfilled people or as ciphers for nature being a metaphor in seattle it would seem is an indian fact and if cities indelibly mark their indian inhabitants in urban ghost stories then these homeless indians also mark the city in return and not just in fictional accounts although more than ten thousand people of indigenous ancestryincluding lawyers and activists bus drivers and artists bankers and newspaper editorsnow call seattle home it is the homeless indians who are most visible in seattle urban land t h e h a u n t e d c i t y scape and who in fact seem to make seattle seattle they make pike place markets public restrooms one of the city true landmarks according to one local alternative weekly because the toilets are the one place where bustling tourists drunken indians and desperate junkies come together in a sort of cultural nexus representing all that is truly great about this fine city for some like local essayist emily baillargeon native people on the streets signify urban inequality as new corporate legions rush home or to their afterhours playgrounds she wrote during the hightech boom of the s they brush past alcoholic native americans camped out on rainslicked corners even among the homeless themselves native people are part of seattle geography one white street kid in the university district for exam ple noted that downtown its all drunk indians so while we can infer from some ghost stories that native people are somehow incapable of being fully human in seattlethat the urban and the indian are some how antonymswe also learn more about this place through stories about indians what kind of city seattle is and who belongs where none of this is to say that homelessness and other more subtle forms of dislocation are not central to the urban indian experience on the contrary loss of cultural identity debilitating poverty and institution alized racism have each shaped the lives of many native people through out seattle history the history that follows makes this clear the problem with stories about metaphorical urban indians however is that they allow us to imagine only certain kinds of native history in the city the parts we are prepared to see by the stories we tell these stories mask more complicated experiences the surprising opportunities offered by urban life the creative struggles to carve out indian spaces in the city and most importantly the ways in which native women and men have contributed to urban life stories of ghosts and totem poles and dis possessed chieftains cast indians only as passive victims of rather than active participants in the urban story these placestories are the easy way out allowing us to avoid doing our homework in other words they make appealing fiction but bad history if the prophetic chieftains and totem poles like the shamanic rains and homeless ghosts are all supposed to make seattle somehow unique and each of these stories is tied closely to urban boosterism and marketing as we shall see then it is surprising how closely seat tles stories track with national narratives our city placestories and those of our nation mirror each otherindians and cities exist at oppo site ends of the american imaginary one represents the past while the other represents the future for all their differences last mohicans final showdowns at wounded knees and lone ishis wandering out of the california foothills are variations on the same theme the inevitable disappearance of indigenous peoples before the onslaught of amer ican progress cities on the other hand are the ultimate avatars of that progress representing the pinnacle of american technology commerce and cultural sophistication it comes as no surprise then that many nineteenthcentury representations of american expansion show indi ans watching forlornly as townscapes appear on the horizon john gasts famous american progress for example shows progress embod ied as an enormous and dare we say it ghostly white woman float ing westward over the continent trailing telegraph wire behind her a locomotive steams across the plains and a great city of bridges and smokestacks sprawls in the sunrise while ahead of her indians and buffalo flee into the shrinking darkness seattle counterpart is a brochure selling real estate on the tideflats south of downtown it fea tures figures that look suspiciously like hiawatha and pocahontas gazing over placid waters toward a belching urban skyline these are place stories telling us how the nation became what it is and who belongs whereand when if popular culture has placed cities and indians at two ends of the nations historical trajectory then academic scholarship has given that placestory its legitimacy the connections between urban and indian historiesboth in seattle and across the nationhave yet to be made even in studies of the american west a region defined both by its urban nature and by the persistence of native peoples from the allegheny mountains to the pacific coast towns and cities were the vanguards of american conquest appearing and sometimes disappearing again with stunning rapidity the survival of western cities hinged on their ability to control hinterlands of people places and thingsloggers goldfields t h e h a u n t e d c i t y waterand so the consolidation and conquest of the american west were urban phenomena in urban histories however indians all too often appear only in the introduction or first chapter then exit stage left after a treaty or a battle its regional mythology and much of its scholarship still defined by the battle between civilization and savagery the amer ican west seems to have room for either cities or indians but not both meanwhile the vast literature on native peoples in the american west has uncovered the economic political cultural and social components of indian dispossession as well as the diverse ways in which native people responded ranging from accommodation to resistance much of this western indian history has focused on reservations and for a good rea son these are the places where colonial policies created long paper trails and these are the places where indigenous and tribal ways of life have remained most visible in cities indians are harder to find and as a result among the thousands of books monographs and articles on indian his tory in the west only a scant few focus on urban places when scholars do study indians in cities their research falls into two camps first there are studies of the problems facing native people in urban places often focusing on the notion of disaffiliation while offering insights into the experiences of native people in cities such studies including many conducted in seattle often pathologize their subjects and take for granted the alleged inability of many native people to cope with urban and by association modern life the second kind of scholarship about urban indians based in the new social history inspired by the civilrights movements of the s and s focuses on the development of urban indian organizations in cities through out the country more than simply institutional histories these works also examine the role such organizations have played in the creation of new indian and especially panindian identities increasingly they are written by native people themselves but virtually none of these works of recent urban indian history include the deeper indigenous histo ries of the places where those organizations took form if urban and native histories rarely speak to each other then the histories of indige nous peoples on whose lands cities were built and the histories of presentday urban indian communities are also estranged in native seattle i bring together multiple kinds of native history in order to challenge the assumption that indian and urban histories are somehow mutually exclusive i include histories of the indigenous people of seattleof the duwamish and shilshole and lake peoples who helped birth the city and yet who bore its greatest burdens i also include histories of the many indian migrants from dozens of tribes and communities who have been coming to this place for much longer than most of us realize lastly i include the chief seattle speech and other indian imagery that has often been closely linked to debates about who belongs in the city and what it has meant to live in a place that has been transformed so quickly and so utterly throughout seattle past the strands of urban and indian history have been entwined and there is very little distance in either space or time between the dispossession of local indigenous people the rise of an urban panindian community and the development of urban narra tives populated with indian metaphors at almost every turn what it meant to be urban and what it meant to be native have been inextri cably linked in seattle the histories in these pages are drawn not just from the mythic nar ratives of seattle received history but from archival materials and oral traditions they are linked to particular places in the city and to the dra matic changes that have quite literally taken place on seattle shores and hills and streets while not as explicitly an environmental history as other studies native seattle nonetheless combats the urbanindianas metaphor stereotype by not only describing the lived experiences of native people in the city and its hinterland but by grounding the city within particular native places ranging from a fishing camp buried beneath fill in the heart of the city to a british columbia village linked to seattle by trade and migration by examining the environmental transforma tions of these places and the movement of people things and symbols between and among them this book links seattle urban native pasts to the broader scholarship regarding the resettlement of indigenous ter ritories the ecology of cities and their hinterlands and narratives regard ing nature culture and history one place where these kinds of histories come together is pioneer t h e h a u n t e d c i t y place park at the corner of first avenue and yesler way where a long vanished sawmill once powered seattle commercial beginnings here a tlingit totem pole a bronze bust of seeathl and an art installation calling attention to the struggles of homeless indians represent the three facets of seattle native iconography the exotic aesthetics of the north ern northwest coast the noble urban namesake and the pathetic indian of the streets pioneer place park like the historic pioneer square neigh borhood that surrounds it is an archive of urban narratives but in whul shootseed the indigenous language of puget sound country neither carries the name pioneer a word that reflects only one version of his tory in whulshootseed it is little crossingover place long before henry yesler set up his sawmill this was a tidal lagoon tucked behind a small island it was home to great cedar longhouses whose residents fished for flounders in the lagoon gathered berries and bulbs in nearby prairies drank clear water from springs in the hillside and buried their dead on a bluff overlooking elliott bay before it was a place of narra tives about indians then this was a place inhabited by indians and long after yeslers sawmill had burned pioneer place became for a while at least the heart of an urban indian community whose members eked out a living in the district of flophouses and taverns that birthed the term skid road different places with the same set of coordinates lit tle crossingover place skid road and pioneer place park are three layers in an urban palimpsest a gathering of placestories in between them lie ashes and sawdust brick and asphalt opportunity and misery in other words the detritus of seattle native multiple pasts there is little crossingover place where an indigenous commu nity gave way to sawmills and singleresident occupancy hotels but there is also the larger crossingover place of seattle as a whole go virtually anywhere in seattle and you are close to it among the bungalows and beachside biking trails are the home of a sacred horned serpent the site of a burning longhouse and an upland clearing full of marsh tea and cranberries between and behind the art galleries and gas stations are the first indian center the riverside studio of a native artist hired to carve totem poles and the apartment of a woman down from juneau to get an education the entire city is a palimpsest a text erased only partially and then written over again it is a landscape of places changed by power of indian places transformed into urban ones and sometimes back again or to borrow the words of historian james ronda the story of seattle is a story about power and places and what happens when power changes places and then how places are in turn changed seat tles past is rich with these kinds of crossings native seattle is also intended as a crossing of different kinds of his tory beyond bringing together urban and indian histories it also brings cultural social and environmental histories into conversation with each other literary criticism and postcolonial studies have emphasized the power of narrative to define debase and control the other and seat tle is no exception the placestories told in this city were a key method of dispossession and discrimination and in trying to understand them native seattle is a cultural history but as cole harris the elder states man of canadian geography has shown it is not enough to merely tell stories about stories we must look beyond the literary and cultural forms of colonialism to examine the material conditions that ultimately implemented those stories we need to examine the roles that physical power the state flows of capital and technologies like law and mapping played in turning indigenous territory into a modern metropolis i accom plish this here through the lenses of social historythe unearthing of the lived experiences of ordinary peopleand environmental history nature may not have agency in this story as clearly as it does in most works of environmental history but the irruptions of unfinished his tory so common in seattle urban story are grounded in place as the land is transformed it gives up new stories and reveals new layers of the past and in those new stories can be found the agency of ancient inhabited natures finally it should not be forgotten that all environ mental history in the americas by definition is native history because it has all happened on indian land with these multiple native histories in mind then seattle story can offer insights into other places for all its uniqueness again few large american cities have so consistently used indian imagery to define their own image seattle history suggests that other cities may have urban indian stories of their own in chicago with its origins in the t h e h a u n t e d c i t y fort dearborn massacre or in new york city and its question as edwin g burrows and mike wallace have called the dutch purchase of indigenous manhattan the opportunities exist for a new kind of urban history that begins with those cities placestories meanwhile bring ing the benevolent friars and pious neophytes who haunt the place stories of californian cities into conversation with native social history might reorient the meaning of places like san francisco and los ange les every american cityboston omaha honolulu savannahhas the potential for this kind of history as do places like vancouver or vera cruz sapporo or sydney or any other place shaped by encounters between the urban and the indigenous in the end though all history is local and so i limit my view to one city and in doing so reorient seattle urban story by placing its native histories at the center i challenge narratives of civic progress by focus ing on the costs both planned and unforeseen of urban development this is not always a happy story in his classic remarkable study of the marquesas greg dening describes the metaphorical islands and beachesthe categories of we and they and the boundaries between themthat shaped the history of real islands and beaches in the pacific he notes that for the people who experienced them and to some extent for the people who study them the remaking of those sorts of islands and the crossing of those sorts of beaches can be cruelly painful this is certainly true of seattle history or in the words of poet colleen mcel roy seattle awful history where all that is breathtaking is breath tak ing this is not always a happy story but perhaps more importantly it is rarely a simple one either seattle is haunted by urban conquest and by its many native pasts but put the ghost stories aside and see what happened here before the ghosts came begin at the supposed beginning at the moment when the first breath was taken in seattle version of the encounter between pawtuxet and plymouth between indigenous and european worlds on a beach to be precise urban renewal in indian territory i n the city of totem poles and native ghosts real live indi ans seemed to reappear suddenly in on the morning of march more than a hundred native men women and children gath ered at fort lawton a decommissioned army base on high bluffs in northwest seattle spreading out they quickly entered the fort from all sides scaling the fences while a diversionary force raised a ruckus at the main gate as military police descended puyallup activist bob sati acum read a statement addressed to the great white father and all his people claiming fort lawton in the name of all american indi ans by the right of discovery invoking treaties supposedly promising surplus government land to tribes the activists demanded the fort most of the proclamation went unheard in the ensuing chaos of scuffles and handcuffs but news of the invasion quickly spread around the world according to the seattle times an italian news agency correspondent had asked you cant imagine how fascinating this story is in europe indians attacking a fort in the west of the united states tell me do you have an indian problem out there meanwhile frontpage photos of uniformed white men carting native women and children off to jail ensured that seattle indian problem joined student protests and car pet bombings as earlys hot political topics this was political theater at its best the native invaders of fort law ton had no legal authority on which to claim land in seattle even if their proclamation did riff on the legal frameworks established by treaties these were urban indians most with no connections to the duwamish lake and shilshole peoples whose territories had become the city of seattle but by what it meant to be indian in america and what it meant to be american on indian landwas changing and as a result the placestory native activists were telling in seattle was a new one this city and this land are ours they shoutedand for the first time seattle and the world seemed to be listening but this was only one of several placestories being told by urban indians in postwar seattle as native people from many tribes and nations worked to make the city home they told stories as diverse as their communities of origin some actively participated in the city romantic narrative of the denny party while others wove seattle urban history into a broader story of genocide and dispossession still other urban indians including the city most destitute struggled simply to assert their basic humanity in a civic story that cast them as little more than symbols of racial decay in each case the stories native people told about their place in seattle had everything to do with the changes in the city and in what it meant to be indian and american as cultural political and even environmental landscapes shifted in the decades after the second world war so would seattle indian placestories and those stories would be as complicated and diverse as urban indians them selves urban renewal would have many conflicting meanings as native people worked to make seattle home t o say that seattle urban indian activism began with the invasion of fort lawton in is a bit like saying that seattle urban history origins lie only at alki point if the indian attack of the vietnam era took most of seattle by sur prise it was only the latest and most visible of a series of efforts by urban native people to claim space in seattle to understand the origins of indian struggles to find home in seattle we must go back to an earlier war epidemics and railroads had been the great forces that shaped seat tles urban history in the nineteenth century but the pivot on which the city twentiethcentury history turned was war the great war had helped complete seattle arrival on the world stage but it was the sec ond world war that would truly transform seattle into a city of global significance more than perhaps any other american city seattle would be changed by the necessities of prosecuting war in europe africa and the pacific the changes were most obvious in the kinds of work people u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y did in the city where in the s lumber mills and canneries were the main industry in the region by the s the shipyards and hangars and foundries that supplied the allies with machines of war had changed the city economy in profound ways between and for example seattle manufacturing base doubled the number of people employed in manufacturing went from in to in across the american west cities were being trans formed by wartime industry the battleships and warplanes from seattleincluding one called chief seattlehelped turn the course of global conflict just as they cemented seattle new role in the global economy seattle was now boeings town the second world war had begun a new chapter in seattle urban story and it also marked a turning point in indian history as indians moved to the city to work on behalf of the war effort adeline skultka a young kaigani haida from craig alaska was one of these after grad uating from high school she came to seattle with her sister and a cousin and immediately found work on a boeing assembly line and as a welder in a local shipyard soon after she met her filipino husband genaro gerry garcia despite the long history of indian migration to seat tle for people like skultka moving to the wartime city involved a steep learning curvebut as before the city beckoned with opportunity espe cially compared to the grim prospects back home a lot of them had never been off the reservation before remembered lillian chapelle cowlitzyakama and yet there were jobs here in seattle like ser vice on the battlefield work on the home front proved that native people could be both indian and american the enthusiasm and opportunity of the war would soon fade though when at wars end cancellation of government contracts at the shipyards and factories led to layoffs and as returning soldiers clam ored for jobs women and people of color were the first to go mean while native veterans struggled to reintegrate into civilian society and indians who depended on the waning extractive industries of old seat tle found themselves increasingly adrift although the economy regained its footing in the s the benefits of the boom rarely trickled down to urban indians who experienced discrimination in virtually every aspect of life chinese restaurants that refused to hire nonwhite waitresses vacant apartments mysteriously rented hospitals that refused to serve native people murders of homeless indians that went uninvestigated during a period when federal indian policy enthusiastically encouraged assimilation into mainstream society and few if any resources existed for the native community the economic and social realities of s seattle afforded urban indians little security and even less hope the result was that many indian men and women who came to seattle ended up on skid road the area that included pioneer square and much of first avenue stretching all the way north to belltown in his much beloved history skid road murray morgan described men sit ting on curbs and sleeping in doorways condemned buildings missions and taverns and wine shops and stores where you can buy a suit for for morgan and many other seattleites downtown particularly belltown first avenue and pioneer squarehad become the place of dead dreams populated by the aging workforce of old seattle which one memoir called the discards from the mael strom of industrial activity the streets and rundown hotels of skid road were also home to hundreds of indians colville architect lawney reyes for example recalled that during those years if you wanted to see an indian in seattle youd jump in the car and go down to skid row in the census percent of pioneer squares inhabitants were either indian or oriental and the district included the largest most concentrated population of native people in the city out in the hin terland many indian reservation residents described skid roads as places where people disappeared almost as if they had diedand sometimes the deaths were real cirrhosis a fall under a passing train tuberculo sis a knife in the ribs after the brief window of wartime opportunity life in seattle was almost as bleak as ever for its indian population if not worse the seven women who came together in the s to address this problem were unlikely activists most had come to seattle during the sec ond world war to work in the defense industries and unlike most native people now enjoyed the relative security of working and middleclass life focusing their energies on volunteering at churches and their u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y childrens schools on the surface they were paragons of assimilation christian married with mixedrace children and productive members of postwar society at the same time it was these seven women who would lay the foundations for the radical action at fort lawton more than twenty years later they first met in under the leadership of pearl warren a makah who had come to the city after the war pearls daughter mary jo butterfield had recently brought home a desperate indian couple left on the streets after the wife was discharged from the hospital like ann petersons home in s ballard this postwar makah household was a refuge for urban indians inspired in part by that expe rience warren butterfield adeline skultka garcia and their friends decided that if resources for native people in seattle were going to exist native people needed to create them they began visiting apartment buildings downtown hotels and the greyhound stationanywhere they might find other indian women by the fall of they had more than fifty members whose tribal communities ranged from washington and alaska to canada and the plains with the help of erna gunther a uni versity of washington anthropologist the group incorporated that year as the american indian womens service league for almost two decades the service league would be seattle lead ing urban indian organization pearl warren adeline garcia and the other founders described the role they hoped to play in the inaugural issue of the service leagues newsletter the newcomer to the city will find the service league a good place to meet other indian women and make new friends and those who want to learn more about conditions and developments that may eventually affect their own livesindian legislation medical care employment etcwill hear new and vital information at each meeting and to those who can see a way of picking up and straightening out the threads from the tangle of indian affairs there is the opportunity of doing a real service to the indian community locally statewide or even nationally and always the leaders of the service league connected everyday life both to tribal traditions and to indian politics on scales ranging from the local to the national where else but in an indian paper asked one writer in the newsletter would you find such unique receipts sic such as sturgeon spinal cord and buckskin bread legends written as told by the old people the lords prayer in chinook she then con tinued by pointing out that the newsletter would also cover land and claim decisions intertribal meetings fishing and hunting house and senate bills pending on local and national levels and other key issues in indian political life but creating community in the city also meant finding a place with that in mind the service league opened seattle first indian center in in a rented storefront at first and vine at the northern end of skid road two years later they moved into a larger space across from the greyhound bus depot where totem poles and statues of chief seattle greeted nonindian visitors to seattle here real indians greeted real indi ans as service league members kept an eye on the bus station look ing for new arrivals fond memories of the indian center highlight the sense of community created by the women who ran it in for example choctaw seattleite harvey davis and his wife nellie recalled the many things the center had provided over the years food if he was hungry a friend if he was friendless shoes if he was bare foot sympathy and advice if he was troubled thrown out if he was drunk returned to his people if he was lost a quiet place to sit and read or con template free clothing on thursdays an opportunity to help our less fortunate tribesmen most important for the davises the center provided a feeling of warmth and friendship which can be found in few if any other places in seattle in a city where most indian people were at worst ostra cized or at best neglected the center was a kind of home where even the poorest of seattle indian community could contribute adeline garcia recalled how those bums on first avenue theyd come in and clean up the place bringing produce and fish from the public market when they could afford it and offering skills such as carpen try in return for a hot meal and a place to stretch out and rest mary u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y jo butterfield meanwhile described the struggles of one blackfoot indian center volunteer sitting in a house out at high point public housing with five hungry kids and youre an alcoholic and youre trying to dry out and take care of your kids and you cant feed them and you dont have any moneyyou dont have bus fare to get to the indian center to get groceries and you dont have a phone those kind of people were the ones that worked the hardest and got the most out of it here was selfhelp here were grass roots here were indian people of many nations creating a place in the city but despite the efforts of the service league not everyone felt com fortable being native in seattle where those no indians allowed signs still hung in windows and according to puyallup activist ramona ben nett a lot of indians were still trying to pass as italian in response the service league saw public relations as a critical element of its mis sion equal to providing services to native people the north amer ican indian benefit ball at the masonic temple for example showcased crafts and dances and used television and radio spots to encourage non indians to attend similarly wellattended picnics at seward park on lake washington involved lummi dancers speeches and stories in the makah language and door prizes of baskets and handmade sweaters but the groups signature event was the salmon bake at alki point which by was feeding more than two thousand people and had become a highlight of the annual seafair festivities often as part of reenact ments of the denny partys landing at alki league members then did not work to overturn the city placestory in the s instead they lobbied to become part of itas living indian people participating in celebrations of urban founding did not preclude out spoken advocacy on native political issues in particular service league members worked to increase nonindians awareness of the short comings of federal indian policy most notably the relocation and ter mination policies of the postwar years one of which sent native people to cities only to abandon them and the other of which sought to negate treaties by dissolving reservations and annulling the federaltribal rela tionship altogether pearl warren for example represented the service league in particular and urban indians in general before a us sen ate subcommittee on indian affairs in and that same year the service league helped organize an international urban indian confer ence in seattle that welcomed activists and community organizers from the united states and canada to share stories and strategies but fund ing for their efforts was hard to come by even as the city political land scape shifted toward a multicultural civic politics and as the federal government began to fund programs in other minority communities so much money was coming into seattle recalled lakota service league member letoy eike and indians were not getting anything for two years service league members tried to convince city officials to earmark money for an indian center in a vacant site at the south end of lake union but as one observer commented the city passed the buck while millions of dollars poured into the predominantly african american central district one model cities project even paid for cen tral district youth to carve a totem pole portraying the nations black history which must have underscored the disparities between the city black and indian communities urban indian strategies in seattle were about to change however for some younger urban indians including an indian center volun teer named bernie whitebear the frustration was building whitebear born bernie reyes and a colville from eastern washington was one of many who had come to seattle to work at boeing in that sense he was like adeline garcia but whitebears activism represented a new style of indian leadership in seattle although concerned by the dom inance of african american concerns in seattle racial politics he was also inspired by the work of seattle black latino and asian amer ican communities whitebear and his allies began to formulate a more multiculturaland more radicalapproach to claiming space in the city and so when the city the army and the bureau of indian affairs dragged their feet on a proposal for a new indian center at the recently decommissioned fort lawton and indian activists took over alcatraz island the stage was set for a new chapter in seattle urban indian history u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y the occupation of alcatraz by american indian movement activists and others in had garnered international attention and by capi talizing both on the successes of other movements radical strategies and on a growing popular interest in and sympathy toward indige nous peoples the occupation of alcatraz was a turning point for native activism focusing international attention on the everyday lives of indian people in the united states while the takeover of alcatraz was a failure in the sense that indian people and institutions never achieved permanent tenure on the rock it was a phenomenal success in that it inspired similar tactics among red power activists throughout the nation and brought public attention to native issues and so on that brisk march morning in more than a hundred indians took fort lawton the invasion was a radical departure from the more diplomatic tra ditions of the service league activists nothing made this more obvi ous than the allies the takeover attracted alcatraz veteran leonard peltier radical black comedian dick gregory and antiwar feminist jane fonda all came to offer their support so did the radical seattle liberation front which had recently held a protest naming part of the university of wash ington campus the peoples republic of leschi after the man who led the attack on the city the tactics of the takeover were a far cry from the salmon bakes and mayoral meetings of the service league protestors were more than willing to be arrested and they even hired a skywriter to pen a new day fort give up fort surrender over the city there were however connections between the fort lawton activists and the service league league founder ella aquino for example was among those who scaled the fences at fort lawton and she and other league members armed with sandwiches and coffee supported the occupation from behind the scenes and reprinted the fort lawton proclamation in indian center news and in a broader sense the fort lawton leadership carried the same hopes as the service league in their proclamation protestors described their vision for fort lawton we feel that this land of ft lawton is more suitable to pursue an indian way of life as determined by our own standards by this we meanthis place does not resemble most indian reservations it has potential for modern facilities adequate sanitation facilities health care facilities fresh running water educational facilities and transportation facilities point for point this was the same vision that pearl warren had pur sued for years she had always wanted to move beyond a crisisdriven indian center and create lasting proactive indian institutions in the city despite their more radical and visible tactics the invaders of fort lawton were the political descendants of those first seven women who had come together back in many nonindian seattleites dismissed the invasion of fort lawton as mere silliness one native woman for example quit her job after her boss told her that the takeover was pretty stupid and that the indi ans were dumb for doing it and had no reason for doing it but despite negative reactions from some nonindians eggs and insults thrown death threats made and neighborhood petitions calling for an end to the noise and stupid acts by the end of the invasion more than forty nonindian organizations in the city had come to support the occupa tion including the seattle human rights commission whose bias toward african american concerns had frustrated indian leaders in the past and within two years of the invasion united indians of all tribes as the activists came to be known had negotiated an agreement with the city with the help of senator henry scoop jackson sixteen acres of fort lawton soon to be renamed discovery park would be leased for an indian cultural and socialservices center when the daybreak star cultural center finally opened in the postintelligencer called it a proud day not just for indians but for the city that had found ways to compromise with activists as service league member arlene red elk put it they got their spot the spot they had gotten was a distinctively indian one designed by architect lawney reyes bernie whitebears brother the daybreak star cultural center was inspired by lakota spiritual leader black elks vision of a star that had come down to earth and taken root to form a sheltering tree and the buildings four wings built of timber donated by northwest tribes represented the four directions meanwhile the u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y public spaces of daybreak star were filled with art made by indian people of many tribes creek tlingit chiricahua apache caddo cowlitz and aleut among others just as seattle connections to the world had widened in the years since the second world war so had its indian hin terland no more was that hinterland just a woven coast it was now a woven continent but the outward successes of the urban indian community sym bolized by the opening of daybreak star masked new rifts that were starting to open within that community one rift came from the left ist multiracial mode of organizing that whitebear and his supporters had pursued according to diane vendiola whose filipino father and swinomish mother had met in seattle back in the s these activists had pursued what she called the city mode its confrontational strate gies and connections to other minority communitiesespecially african americans and antiwar radicalsalienated some older activists this same tension would also arise on reservations as indian men and women energized by leftist tactics honed primarily in urban places brought those visions of revolution back to their home communities other rifts were widened by success itself as urban indian programs began to finally receive public funding they seemed to become less indian to many community members as marilyn bentz explained it once money came into the picture things changed and it got a lot more political that turned off a lot of people harvey and nellie davis felt the same way recalling the early indian center as a place without a lot of gobbledygook double talk social service workers lingo unlike the new postfort lawton institutions for many members of the urban indian community the institutional success of the indian center made it less of a native place and more like any other socialservice agency at the same time the successes of seattle indian community had profound impacts far beyond the city as volunteers activists and ser vice professionals earned their stripes in the urban milieu and then took their skills and experience back out into indian country women who had been involved in the american indian womens service league which carried on with its work even as united indians of all tribes grabbed most of the public attention were among the best examples of this new generation of native leadership that had been forged in seat tle adeline garcia went on to become a board member of the innova tive seattle indian heritage high school and served as a liaison among reservations the seattle public schools and colleges ramona bennett became chair of her puyallup tribe while joyce reyes wife of lawney and president of the service league after pearl warren became a bureau of indian affairs administrator these and other women would play crucial roles in the ascent of selfdeterminationindian control over indian livesin the s but back in seattle where the daybreak star cultural center with its origins in the work of the service league told a new placestory by claiming that the city could indeed be indian land there was another new urban indian placestory taking form this one told a very differ ent tale from that of united indians of all tribes and the american indian womens service league as it would turn out the postwar suc cesses experienced both by the indian community and by seattle itself were a doubleedged sword as public dollars poured into the city to support programs like model cities daybreak star and the new indian center other forces of urban renewal were at work during the same years that indians and other activists claimed spaces in a newly multi cultural city and demanded public investment in communities of color other civic leaders began to invest in the city historical heritage for native americans on skid road life was about to get more difficult as the same forces of urban affluence that helped to create new indian spaces in the city forced the city poorest indians quite literally onto the streets i n the seattle arts commission launched an ambi tious program called in public a citywide set of installations designed to inspire dialogue about the role of art in everyday urban life from the enormous proletarian hammering man in front of the seattle art museum to huge banners hung from light poles demanding do you prefer being on welfare in public was edgy and controversial one of the most confrontational pieces by cheyennearapaho artist u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y hachivi edgar heap of birds was installed in pioneer place park along side the chiefofallwomen pole and the bronze bust of chief seat tle called daynight it consisted of two ceramic panels inscribed with dollar signs crosses and text in whulshootseed and english that read chief seattle now the streets are your home far away brothers and sisters we still remember you dedicated to the city homeless indi ans daynight challenged seattle other placestories in the city of seattle there are countless references to our indigenous people wrote heap of birds from professional football helmets of the seahawks seattle nfl team to towering totem poles to the name of the city itself but we do not find institutionalized evidence of the living indige nous people daynight also drew attention to the fact that the city new indian institutions did not necessarily benefit all indian people daybreak star is beautiful heap of birds told one reporter but pioneer square and occidental square are also indian centers in fact by the s skid road had become indian territory as one observer called the area around pioneer square it was an urban neighborhood with its own traditions institutions and ways of operating but as urban renewal historic preservation and heritage tourismall supported by the same kinds of public reinvestment that had helped fund the indian center and daybreak starbecame dominant themes in the s and beyond native skid road would disappear to be replaced by historic districts catering to tourists and as downtown was transformed from historical skid road to historic seattle it would be filled with art like daynight here was the ironic history behind heap of birds instal lation at the same time that it told a radical new placestory confronting the inequalities of postwar urban native life it was also made possible by those inequalities and by the destruction of an indian neighborhood and a neighborhood it was for all its dysfunction for all the poverty and discrimination and cheap booze indian skid road was a commu nity with its own rules and its own distinctive identity to begin with the native population on skid road tended to be fairly stable accord ing to one source they accounted for half the city home guards residents whose home base was in seattle as opposed to the rootless bindle stiffs many of them increasingly elderly white men who migrated from place to place and unlike the general population of skid road the downtown indian community included many women who often held down jobs as barmaids and cooks one former skid road resident said it seemed as if every tavern had a native woman in the kitchen like their service league counterparts the women of skid road were problem solvers they could be depended on for example to know about openings in berry picking dock work carpentry and other jobs among the black jazz clubs gay cabarets chinese restaurants and fil ipino night caf√©s that had also sprung up in the area native skid road had by the s developed into a functioning if troubled commu nity with three key institutions the indian bar the singleresident occu pancy sro hotel and the streets themselves at the end of the second world war it remained illegal to sell liquor to indians in seattle and most downtown taverns refused entry to indian men and women relegating them to the streets but in the late s a general relaxing of state liquor laws allowed the formation of what the local bartenders union called bow and arrow jointsindian tav erns like the lotus the anchor and el cocoscattered along first avenue from pioneer square to belltown each had its own niche one attracted native alaskans who left the bar virtually empty during the summer fishing and logging season another served a younger crowd with more expensive drinks and indian gogo girls while a third fre quented by both indians and mexicans had the roughest reputation the best documented of the skid road indian bars the britannia tav ern catered to veterans loggers railroad men and migrant laborers most with tribal origins in canada washington alaska and the northerntier states at the britannia indians could catch up on gossip from the reser vations drop the guards required by urban life and simply be indian as at the service leagues indian center there was a sense of family at the brittania patrons often referred to the bars coowner a puget sound indian woman as ma mom and little cousin even native people who did not live on skid road found the britannia to be home terri tory one veteran who lived in a middleclass neighborhood often came to the tavern on weekends because his people were there u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y if the bow and arrow joints of skid road were homes away from home it was another downtown institution the sro hotel which often provided actual shelter in more than two dozen hotels some singleoccupancy rooms provided cheap accommodations for native people and other skid road residents even the most rundown sro hotel could be home despite the long dingy and bittersmelling cor ridors of the morrison hotel for example one young indian woman said i loved it here and having ones own hotel room was a sign of status among the indian skid roaders for those who were not so for tunate the romanesque terracotta portico of the pioneer building the benches under the totem pole and the alleys off the main streets were often the only option these public spaces were also native meeting grounds where answers could be found to questions like whats hap pening whos around is joe at the anchor will he lend me five dollars skid road then was truly indian territory but time was not on the side of skid road indian or otherwise since the s civic leaders had been entertaining proposals for the revitali zation of downtown and especially of pioneer square most proposals included historic preservation after all this was the city birthplace but the plan that became the favorite of business leaders john graham and companys design proposed razing all but four blocks around pioneer place park the chiefofallwomen pole and the bronze bust of chief seattle would stay as part of a historic plazathose place stories merited preservationbut skyscrapers parking lots and a new highway would replace the rest of skid road in the late s and early s however historic preservation and heritage tourism like mul ticulturalism had become part of seattle new civic language citizen activists quickly decried the graham proposal lobbying instead for the preservation of the entire neighborhood as a national historic district not unlike the pioneers several generations before who had looked to their indian past as metropolis was born in their midst now many of the city residents had begun to look to the city historic places as a balm against rapacious urban development in the postwar era and so the pioneer square historic district among the first in the nation was established in to much selfcongratulation on the part of historically minded seattleites but a nagging question remained what to do with the people who actually called the ground of history home the answers ranged from the derisively violent to the sympa thetically exploitative one downtown businessman simply called skid road residents scum of the earth who should be run out of town while one native skid roader remembered a policeman saying to him they didnt play cowboys and indians long enough they should have killed all you bastards off as for graham and company the foiled levelers of pioneer square they argued that the people of skid road added lit tle if anything to the economy of downtown and suggested relocat ing those who could not be institutionalized in prisons or asylums some supporters of preservation however saw the denizens of skid road as having valuenot as urban citizens but as part of the historic urban landscape mayor wes uhlman for example delighted in welcoming visitors to the city with a tour of skid road i was the only mayor in america who could do that he mused proud of the combination of historic buildings and seedy characters that pioneer square provided bill speidel who led wildly popular historical tours of pioneer squares underground network of streets and storefronts agreed pointing out that if we didnt have the bums around weve have to hire them from central casting for uhlman and speidel the people of skid road had a role to playliterallyin the districts placestory this would be especially true for indians who for so long had been used to repre sent so much armed with new preservation and safety ordinances city officials shut dozens of sro hotels and by the mids three quarters of the city downtown housing stock had been lost and nearly percent of pioneer squares countable population had disappeared the morrison hotel for example closed in it eventually reopened but by more than units of sro housing had been lost in downtown seattle meanwhile the britannia had shut its doors many years beforein the same year that the first historic preservation ordi nance was passedand many of seattle downtown bow and arrow joints followed suit soon after for people who remained on skid road downtowns renaissance u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y was a disaster a large portion of the city heritage and architecture has been saved business has been improved tax revenues are up noted one critic in everything is fine except for the people who used to live here their condition has not been improved but has been made worse and as the hotels closed the people who remained downtown tended to be poorer sicker more often homeless and unemployed and less likely to be white skid road residents who could move on did so while those left behind depended upon the few missions and social ser vices that remained downtown in just a few short years of urban renewal and historic preservation the skid road native community and many of its diverse neighbors had been almost entirely erased by a district of art galleries bookshops restaurants and taverns catering to tourists and the young and middle class indian people meanwhile remained the most visible minority on what was left of skid road struggling to survive alongside more new totem poles one writer noted that vic tims of the white mans scorn can still be seen in doorways and around seattle taverns near pioneer square or lolling on the areas few park benches as though the britannia the morrison and the other insti tutions of native skid road had never existed seattle third indian place story of the homeless native person as an urban allegory had been literally built into the landscape indian people on skid road were more than aware of their own vis ibility as early as the s a handful of voices from skid road expressed defiance toward the role indians had been told to play in seat tles urban narrative mexican indian j a correa for example wrote in about the visibility of indian people in the district pawn shops and broken people who drink and sing and beg for wine they provide amusement for the tourists who believe in historical sites and little kids from school are taken there by devoted bored teachers to see the heart of their grandparents city correas poem is a dramatic alternative to the story of downtowns renaissance illustrating the human costs of urban renewal and what it meant to try to live in what was now the ground of official urban history meanwhile architect laurie olin described meeting some of the remaining skid road indians while sketching pioneer square street scapes in the s one morning under the pergola an indian sat down next to me and said how are you at drawing scars and grinned these people whose iden tity has been so brutally denied wanted to see that they were still there my drawings seemed to reaffirm their existence draw me man draw me draw me next ill hold still right here said one a quarter century later earle thompson a yakama writer who had spent years on skid road highlighted the ongoing visibility of homeless indian people downtown in a mission doorway a innum indian puts a green bottle up to his lips he begins to sing gimme minutes only five minutes more let me stay ahyahaye he pounds his fist on the wall a couple passes and he smiles at them like the service league members holding their public events and the fort lawton activists reading their proclamation here at last twelve decades after the founding of seattle were indian voices telling a new placestory or more to the point here at last twelve decades after the founding someone was listening and writing it down it was against this backdrop of historic preservation and the erasure of skid roads indian history that edgar heap of birds daynight was installed to wide acclaim columnist and cartoonist david horsey wrote for example amid the human wreckage congregating around the pio neer square pergola it seemed that it would be redundant to point out the tragic circumstances of some of chief seattle tribal descendants but instead the panels stand like exclamation points among the liv ing proof of their indictment the irony of daynight though is that it too is part of the gentrification of the neighborhood created to speak to those who visit pioneer place park and pioneer square in search of stories about the city when asked in what she thought of u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y daynight margaret a homeless aleut woman referred to it simply as fucking white man bullshit to some extent she was right with out the crowds who frequent historic pioneer square daynight would have little meaning and even less of an audience and perhaps most importantly it says what many expected all along that indians and cities cannot coexist after all heap of birds took his pieces title from one version of the chief seattle speech day and night cannot dwell together the red man has ever fled the approach of the white man as the changing mist on the mountainside flees before the blazing sun in both english and the first language of this place called seattle here again is what we mistake for history a placestory telling us what we already thought we knew d aybreak star daynight two astronomical metaphors speaking radically different placestories one tells us this city is indian land the other this city is no place for indians their conflicting tales of the connections between native people and the city capture the conflicts inherent in urban indian his tory what does it mean to be native in the city can people even be native in the city and what about the fact that throughout seattle history whether during the creation of the ship canal or the ouster of native skid road civic leaders seemed determined to make the city into a place that was no place for indians the story of indian activism in the city and the destruction of indian skid road can be understood only in the context of the changing nature of seattle itself before the second world war seattle was a city of lumber mills racial segregation and skid road fifty years later it was city of whitecollar industry multicultural poli tics and urban renaissance in which reinvestment in cityhood meant both the creation of institutions like the indian center and daybreak star and the destruction of an indian neighborhood in the name of his toric preservation as in earlier periods in seattle past changes in the city led to new possibilities and challenges for the native american com munity just as changes in seattle native community led to new urban stories for all their complexity these stories together attest to a single clear fact that indian history can and does happen in urban places more than thirty years after the invasion of fort lawton new sto ries are still being written in there were some four thousand indi ans in the city by the end of the century there were nearly three times that number despite the rise in native population though voluntary groups like the service league had begun to fade soon after the suc cesses of the s indian people were more able to get jobs and edu cation and so forth recalled marilyn bentz with the result that the volunteers werent as necessary meanwhile the radical activism that had helped reconfigure civic politics faded as well as life in the city got better and ethnic institutions became more bureaucratic but challenges remained and at the beginning of the twentyfirst century the range of native organizations in seattle attests both to the ongoing pressure to reconcile what it means to be indian with what it means to be urban and to the amazing capacity of the indian community to respond to its members needs at daybreak star united indians of all tribes offers head start classes fostercare advocacy culturally appro priate therapy outpatient treatment for substance abuse ged general equivalency diploma courses and housing referrals in addition to its annual powwow and an ongoing art market the seattle indian health boardhoused in a building named after leschioffers medical and dental services and coordinates access to traditional healers a group called queer oyate supports native people with hiv and aids while the chief seattle club founded without permission by a jesuit priest in the s to serve homeless indians in pioneer square still man ages to operate among the galleries and nightclubs there are even a couple of indian bars in town meanwhile the service league is under going a renaissance of its own with members involved in virtually every aspect of the community and the iwasil youth group has recently formed the nations first urban indian boys and girls club all speak to the enormous creativity and strength of native people in seattle according to lawney reyes the architect of daybreak star im very proud of the survival of urban people the government theyre still scratching their head were supposed to be extinct by the help of our own government and somehow we have managed to survive even when u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y native people have been placed in environments that are unlivable we still find a place to create home all that was unlivablethe benches in occidental park the dingy rooms in the morrison hotel the projects at high pointis being transformed perhaps the most ironic result of that transformation and of seat tles urban indian story comes from this place itself from ideas about the connections between indians and nature and from the simple fact that the city native community made up of families and individuals from scores of tribes has grown up on territory that once belonged to other native people back in bernie whitebear had played the nature card if were allowed to take over this land we would leave it in its natural state he told the press at fort lawton we wouldnt destroy the natural areas there we would preserve the land the way the indi ans have always done later when daybreak star finally opened the progressive seattle weekly saw the new facility as part of an indian renaissance that would lead to preservation of the earth but twenty years later the idea of indians as inherent environmentalists would come back to haunt daybreak star when united indians of all tribes pro posed building conference and museum facilitiesa peoples lodge in discovery park concerned over aesthetics parking and openspace preservation local nonindian residents highlighted the plans seem ing betrayal of indian environmental values having played the ecol ogy card in their claims to fort lawton the founders of daybreak star were now held accountable to the stereotype of the ecological indian in responding to the complaints just before his death in white bear unwittingly highlighted the deepest irony about an urban indian community built on indigenous land from the window of my office he wrote in the seattle times i look north from magnolia bluff and imagine the warriors of the haida nation who once paddled their great canoes into puget sound and beached them on the shores below in what is now called shilshole bay thinking of those ancestors he recalled the words attributed to seeathl that claimed that the white man would never be alone in the city but whitebear neglected to mention that those ancient haida warriors had been raiders come to enslave and kill the shilsholes and so the placestory of one urban indian activist came into conflict with another kind of placestory that had been rising dur ing the same years for while seattle urban indian community had been making a place for themselves in the city other indian voices the descendants of the indigenous people of seattlewere also laying claim to the city u r b a n r e n e w a l i n i n d i a n t e r r i t o r y the changers changed i n seeathl seattle namesake died at place of clear water the community from which jacob wahalchoo had once gone out in search of power below the waters of puget sound he was buried on the port madison reservation across puget sound from seattle not far from the enormous main longhouse at place of clear water that settlers called oleman house or old man house meaning wornout house or venerable house in chinook jargon the death of chief seattle garnered little official attention in the city that bore his name no puget sound newspapers announced his passing and while settlers who knew him surely noted his deathperhaps some even mournedseeathl seemed to fade quickly from prominence in seat tles civic consciousness a few years later government agents burned oleman house seeing it as a hindrance to their civilizing mission mean while the descendants of seeathl and their fellow suquamish tribal members tended his grave occasionally a white visitor from off the reservation would place american flags there in memory of the indigenous leaders contributions to the birth of seattle but more often the madroneringed clifftop cemetery facing seattle across puget sound remained a quiet place in the scene at seeathls grave could not have been more dif ferent hundreds of visitors from seattle were on hand enjoying the late august weather and the uss pennsylvanias brass band follow ing a welcome from the local indian agent seattle mayor george w dilling jurist thomas burke and university of washington history pro fessor edmond s meany each gave an address describing seeathls hos pitality toward the first settlers and patriotic songs were sung in english and chinook jargon as souvenirs each guest was given a pho tograph of the grave courtesy of printer and future mayor ole han son this was chief seattle day the sentiment of a chief seattle day in commemoration of the indian chief who befriended the white man in the early days of the puget sound country wrote one participant has appealed strongly to many of seattle prominent citizens those citizens made good on their sentiment by the s chief seattle day included special black ball line excursions picnicking and saltwater swimming while plans were under way to construct a baseball diamond and tennis courts next to the cemetery place of clear water once a fusty impediment to civilization had become a pilgrimage site for those wish ing to commune with their urban indigenous past arthur denny might have been seattle founding father but seeathl generous toward the settlers at alki powerfully articulate during treaty negotiations and unswervingly loyal during the indian warwas its patron saint nowhere was this more obvious than in the bad poetry inspired by visits to his grave one particularly florid example penned by professor meany himself and using the old whulshootseed name for puget sound was read at the pilgrimage to suquamish and later to the university of washingtons graduating class of peace be with thee in thy honored grave o chieftain as pilgrims we lovingly come drawn to a shrine by whulges cool wave suquamish sad fragment in firgirdled home slowly

seeathl was the indian benefactor to a saxon city the placestory of the man and the city that bore his name relied on two premises a notion of a vanishing race and a belief in inevitable angloamerican racial supremacy other wouldbe poets made the connection between seeathl and seat tle even more explicit often apostrophizing the person and the place in the same stanza as california resident florence reynolds did in the s oh city so marvelously fair of face you were born of a noble indian race and to honor their chieftain you were given his name oh seattle great warrior of deathless fame you have a monument that ever will stand a tribute of love to your character grand a city of beauty that is fast growing great a wonder spot in a wonderful state for reynolds a grave paled in comparison to a city itself as a marker of seeathls life similarly white suquamish resident t m crepar a contemporary of reynolds suggested an even closer connection between man and metropolis theres a people thats proud of the story theres a city thats proud of its name like the chief he was in his glory for sealth and seattle the same neath a whitened cross and mound of sod the bones of chief seattle lies sic while across the bay where once he trod seattle towers to the skies included in a brochure sold to gravesite visitors by princess angeline souvenirs the poems claim that sealth and seattle the same reflected popular linkages between the man and the city talking about seeathl and seattle in the same breathusing an indian to explain the cityeemed only natural and in fact nature was at the core of this particular placestory which expressed longing for the lost world of the first americans stories about chief seattle had little to do with the real man named seeathl in a pattern that would come to dominate urban discourse over the twentieth century the city namesake was often little more than a character from central casting and the circumstances in which his image appeared rarely had much to do with actual indians typically reveal ing far more about the portrayers than about seeathl and in fact the symbolic resuscitation of seeathl in the early twentieth century was but one example of the ways in which white seattle residents used indians and indian imagery to tell urban placestories more than appropria tions of indian symbolsa timehonored american traditionthese stories were also ways to work out concerns about a changing city and as such they reflected the conflicting ambitions and anxieties of seat tleites they were stories about place about what had happened here about who belonged here as white seattle turned to indians to tell urban placestories it was clear that the changers had also been changed by the experience of urban conquest and the transformation of this place called seattle o n july a new kind of indian arrived in seattle like so many who had come before on their way to the hop yards or the tideflats he came from the north but there was something different about this indian perhaps it was that he arrived aboard the portland the same auspicious ship that first brought alaskan gold to seattle perhaps it was his dress rather than the plain pants and shirts that most native men wore he sported a chilkat blanket and the tall headpiece of a tlingit noble abalone and copper and yellow cedar announcing an ancient lineage perhaps it was the presence of the fox and the davis twin us navy destroyers that t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d flanked the portland as it entered elliott bay or the thousands of seat tleites gathered on wharves and rooftops blowing whistles to greet him and cheering as calliope music filled the air what made this indian most different from his predecessors though was that he was not an indian at all and no newcomer underneath the mountaingoat wool and cedar headdress were the business suit and balding pate of george allen pacific northwest manager of the national surety company of new york on this day however allen was no runofthemill insur ance executive he was hyas tyee kopa konowaygreat chief of every thing in chinook jargonand he had come to seattle to potlatch between and and again in the s seattle premier urban festival was the potlatch like the alaskayukonpacific exposition aype the potlatch drew on symbols of the city northern hinterland and trumpeted the unique virtues that assured a great future for seat tle its residents and its investors more than just another example of public relations though seattle potlatch festival was also a way for a certain class of seattleitesspecifically the city new commercial elite to tell stories about the city and its history called a triumph of sym bolism by one observer the potlatch appropriated native imagery to create a regional vision of civic development in telling stories about the places that had been linked to seattle through its imperial networks seattle potlatchers crafted a new narrative about what it meant to be not just in this place but in this place that dominated other places in the premier city of the northwest coast seattle potlatches like the aype before them were indicative of the heated competition among western cities in the early twentieth cen tury while seattle regional dominance was largely a fait accompli by the first potlatch in the urban west remained a volatile place where the fortunes of cities could still be won or lost potlatch organizers sought to cement seattle position by creating a signature event all that the mardi gras is to new orleans all that la fiesta is to los angeles all that the rose festival is to portland but why call it potlatch to high light the city modernity why did festival promoters choose a native tradition as their leitmotif the answer centers on the question of wealth and on the idea of a civic generosity that offered the promise of pros perity to all those who lived in seattle and its hinterland that an indian ritual could best articulate this vision made perfect sense to potlatch promoters to the indian of the northwestern water reaches potlatch means a feast to which all of the tribe are bidden and whence they return to their tepees laden with gifts seattle has adopted the indian name and applies literally the indian defi nition it spends or more upon its annual festival and offers it as free as its northwestern air to whomsoever may fare this way no feature of the whole delightful celebration is offered at a price for the potlatch is not established for profit rather it is an annual thankoffering for a prosperity that seems perennial for such beauties of climate and nature as have nowhere on earth their parallel potlatch promoters then cast themselves as humble chiefs generously bestowing the fruit of civic and ecological wealth upon the people of seattle and their guests their choice not only served the message of the festivals but also expressed a longstanding fascination with the potlatch among nonindi ans identified by outsiders as a trademark cultural element of the north west coast potlatch was in fact a constellation of diverse practices used by indigenous people all along the northwestern edge of the con tinent as a way to manage social economic and spiritual relationships in puget sound for example the practice of sgweegwee from the whul shootseed word for invite linked elite families their resources and their spirit powers over great distances through the public performance of a spiritually sanctioned sharing ethic often on occasions such as funer als as one elder said in the s sgweegwee both made a wealthy per sons name high and made it go all over the place this notoriety brought responsibility tulalip elder gram ruth sehome shelton seeastenoo pointed out that the primary purpose of the practice was to keep up the poor to maintain social cohesion through sharing puget sound potlatches however were overshadowed in the public eye by those held further north marked by more lavish ritual per t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d formances the public destruction of wealth and the pageantry of danc ing societies the potlatches of the kwakwakawakw and other north ern northwest coast peoples fascinated academics and the public alike and inspired a vast scholarly and popular literature fascination how ever was tempered by colonial revulsion at the seeming profligacy of indian society expressed in the de jure repression north of the us canada border and in de facto repression south of it in seattle though potlatch became the inspiration for appropriation to borrow gram shel tons words seattle urban potlatchers would use native symbolism to make the city name high and to make it go all over the place here then was an event that represented yet another weft of the woven coast showing how completely seattle urban identity had been transformed by encounters with its indigenous hinterland it did not start out this way the first potlatch in used klondike imagery the presiding figure was king doro the avatar of golden wealth who arrived on the portlandalways the portlandwith a ret inue of hoary prospectors and rambunctious dancing girls the following year though doro was succeeded by hyas tyee kopa konoway the brochure for the festivities described this new incarnation seattle potlatch is unique for it is based upon and is true to the rich tradi tion and history of puget sound and the alaskan coast every pageant every spectacle is colored with the original pigments its principal pageant is a line of a thousand totem poles its emblem is an alaskan grotesque its patron saints the whale the crow the seal the bear and other quaint and startling crests of the native of the northland this was in effect the aypes appropriation of indian images metas tasized citywide the alaskan grotesque inspired by the totem poles of both seattle and alaska was the potlatchs mascot known as the big bug simultaneously an emblem of the festival and an object of racist derision the big bug was a regional cousin to sambo drawn not from the imagined plantations of the south but from the northwest coast of popular imagination the big bugs nearer kin were everywhere in seattle during potlatch the chanty tyees quartet the singing chiefs of the seattle press club sang chinook choruses for hyas tyee kopa konoway allen during his official tour of the city which including mak ing good medicine over the new liner potlatch at the seattle construc tion and dry dock across town three dozen young men performing the totem pole dance as part of the play the alaskan written by joe blethen son of the owner of the seattle times proved a far greater suc cess than the sourdoughs and sad old king doro upon hyas tyee allens ritual departure the times observed that ever after seattle will look to the potlatch for an indian chief and not for a king or queen as high ruler the timess rejection of royalty suggests that the potlatches were dem ocratic or even populist in their conception indeed they were designed as participatory spectacles the events brought brahmin and lowbrow together in a unified civic identity but for all the nods to gen erosity and philanthropy it was potlatch organizers who gained the most from civic potlatching and they did so through an organization that stood at the core of urban power the tilikums of elttaes making their official debut at the unveiling of a newly painted chiefofallwomen pole in the fall of the tilikums friends in chinook jargon elt taes is seattle spelled backward included the most powerful men in seattle during the potlatch parade for example one of the high lights was chief skowls war canoe crewed by some thirty tilikums among them were hyas tyee allens insurance industry colleagues as well as bankers attorneys a presbyterian pastor the seattle postmas ter and staff from both the times and the postintelligencer the canoe also carried j c marmaduke general manager of the new washing ton hotel and the alaska building colonel william t perkins an exec utive with the northern exploration and development company the alaska midland railroad and the northern securities company clyde morris president of nomebased general contractors and the arctic club and joshua green president of the international steamship com pany called the livest of the live wires in seattle these tilikums had made fortunes from the city hinterland whose images their friends at the papers now used to sell the city so perhaps civic potlatching was not about generosity after all t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d soon after their appearance the tilikums became one of the largest civic organizations in seattle a competition among their three com ponent tribes in for example brought in new members bringing the total to tilikums a significant portion of the city white middle and upperclass men their induction ceremony involved the climbing of a totem pole and tongueincheek gossip of human sacrifice circulated through town a reminder of the fascina tion with rumored cannibalistic rites among northwest coast peoples playing indian was a wellestablished american pastime and had always expressed a wide range of political and cultural notions but if the tilikums tried to look like indians they behaved more like their white counterparts in fraternal organizations throughout the country concernedat least on the surfacewith more than simply making money the tilikums also sought to create a new moral climate in the city during their inaugural year for example they erected a totem pole downtown that literally spelled out the values of the tilikums a far cry from the chiefofallwomen pole at the other end of the down town this one stood atop seven steps each engraved with a virtue energy loyalty tradition truth ability equality and successall spelling elttaes for all its gaiety the work of the tilikums was also a moral project its apparent confidence belying deeprooted concerns about modern urban life and the reforming impulses of the progres sive era the work of the tilikums was also a historical project the pot latch parade for instance was a wheeled chronology of seattle impe rial past its placestory cast in crepe and cardboard first came a float belonging to a shaman who used rattles to clear evil spirits from the parade route followed by the hyas tyees own float of walruses ravens and golden cornucopias representing the norths abundance then came the tilikums themselves some wearing papierm√¢ch√© bear eagle and whale masks and others dressed as totem poles with horns braying and drums pounding in the way in which the indians of the north called together the chieftains next came a native pot latch scene complete with slaves and giant feast dishes followed by russ ian alaska a miniature replica of the orthodox church at sitka and russian priests cossacks and indian slaves last but certainly not least came the american period represented by a huge eagle perched on a map of sewards purchase a recreation of chilkoot pass with a regiment of sourdoughs and lastly the home government float a patri otic conception of what the future holds for alaska looking north to articulate seattle urban future potlatch organizers expended little energy on the local past chief seattle the pioneers at alki and other figures and events from seattle preimperial history rarely appeared at potlatch this was a story about place and the place in question was the salmonscented silences goldstrewn arctic creek beds and totem poled villages of seattle hinterlandnot the lands and waters upon which seattle had been built the kind of placestory the tilikums told had everything to do with the kind of men they were and with the kinds of experiences they had had with both cities and indians most members of the tilikums of elttaes were cheechakos people who had arrived during seattle period of rapid population growth that began in the s few of them had experienced seattle illahee for them the city had always been a place of banks and steamships and railroads and tall stone buildings all con nected to alaska and the north pacific to be fair potlatchwhich after all began as alaska daywas never really about seattle history in the first place a glorified street party and publicrelations campaign potlatch was an escape from the past created by men with little inter est in reliving a history few of them had known firsthand at the same time convincing residents visitors and investors of seattle current and future greatness required the creation of a historical trajectory a story for the city and in a sense the tilikums version of seattle his tory was a local story in the crowded world of twentiethcentury urban competition potlatches and totem poles and tribes could provide the city with a unique urban identity among its rivals but their definition of place was a new one as the northwest coasts greatest metropolis the hinter land had for the tilikums become part of seattle local terrain the tilikums might have escaped the local past but they could not escape the global present the and potlatches resembled that of in all the important waystotem poles lining the streets t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d tilikums in their war canoes and the big bug leering at the throngs but seattle biggest festival became increasingly entangled in events in the broader world the potlatch was marred by running battles between enlisted men and the industrial workers of the world and as the world embarked upon the great war in potlatch was scaled back to only four days and received only subdued press coverage in fact the potlatch would be the last for two decades the festival was revived again in to bolster the spirits of a suffering city thanks to a new generation of tilikums with their own hyas tyee kopa kono way tribal chieftains and shamans by the aviation potlatch of the last seattle potlatch as celebration gave way once again to war images borrowed from seattle experience with empire and versions of history that emphasized the regional over the local had come to seem like natural expressions of seattle past although the tilikums had been responsible for creating this new sense of the local based in their own lived experiences in a regional metropolis they did occasionally venerate local history even in the years when potlatch was not held the tilikums participated in other urban ceremonies throwing their weight behind both chief seattle day and commemorations of the land ing of the denny party at alki point and when the men who dressed as totem poles who shook tlingit rattles and spread cannibal rumors about themselves came together to remember these turning points in the local past they came into contact with another group of seat tleites who told a very different placestory but who also used indians to do it t he tilikums of elttaes told one kind of urban story in the early twentieth century pioneers told another as the live wires that powered the dynamo of urban growth the tilikums used indian imagery to sell the city but pioneers and their descendants used indian imagery to express ambivalence about the losses attendant to that growth potlatches were optimistic festivals of promotion while pioneer stories were sentimental markings of the passage of time the two had different purposes one to drum up atten tion in the noisy marketplace of civic public relations the other to pre serve local heritage and revisit fading memories the tilikums looked to the future while the pioneers gazed longingly into the past what they had in common though was that both told stories about indians to give shape to the history of the city to craft their placestory pio neers used accounts of local indigenous people to commemorate their own lives in the city lost landscapes and in doing so cast themselves as a vanishing race in their own right the tilikums were not the only white people playing indian in seattle in the same year that the tilikums dragged the big bug through the city for a potlatch of progress seattle pioneers and their families gathered at the stockade hotel at alki point while potlatches were about extravagance hyperbole and celebration the gathering at alki was some thing quite different the blazing logs crackling in the fireplace noted a seattle postintelligencer observer imparted an air of authenticity and quiet corroboration to the ceremonies which were simple but heartfelt the guest of honor that day was rolland dennyan infant when his parents and their cohort landed on november the last living member of the denny party and as such the only surviving link to those hallowed events dennys presence also made seattle unique in his address to the group mayor arthur langlie pointed out that seat tle was one of the few cities where one of the original founders still liveda backwardlooking kind of boosterism seattle uniqueness in this regard was to last only a few more months rolland denny was dead by the following years gathering this was not the first such gathering for nearly half a century early seattle settlers like their counterparts in other western places had been coming together to commemorate and commiserate the society of washington territory pioneerspioneer defined as someone who had arrived prior to the indigenous uprising of was incorporated in seattle in with arthur denny henry yesler william bell and henry van asselt among the founding members it merged with the larger washington pioneer association in from the outside the groups annual meetings usually held in seattle seemed almost fune real except for quaint anecdotes of settler lifea litany of hapless indi ans runaway horses and jokes about mudthe reunions seemed like t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d a deathwatch a seattle newspaper described one such proceeding in the s charles prosch read his annual report as secretary which was interesting and of pathetic interest especially when we have the names of those recently dead the pathos of this was heighted sic when in response to the reading of the roll call the answer several times given from those present was he is dead these being the names of those who had gone but of whose death mr prosch was not aware the paper then enumerated the dead by name thirtyseven for that year including henry yesler press accounts of pioneer reunions which typ ically included page after verbatim page of members reminiscences highlighted the fact that the generation that had settled seattle along with the way of life they represented was fast disappearing before the onslaught of modern urban life pioneer stories were a way to talk about urban change and offered a counterpoint to the enthusiastic promo tion of boosters like the tilikums of elttaes arthur armstrong denny set the precedent if he is the father of seattle then he should also be known as the father of seattle pioneer malaise in the first published history of the citypioneer days on puget sound printed in denny was the first to express anxiety about the urban transformations taking place around him it is now thirtysix years since i came to puget sound and i am more and more impressed with the fact as each succeeding year rolls by that the early settlers of the country will very shortly all have crossed over the river and be soon forgotten for we may all concede the fact that we shall be missed but little when we are gone and that little but a short time but when we have met the last trial and our last camp fire has died out some may desire a knowl edge of such facts as we alone can give here was another kind of crossing in the crossingover place of seat tle between two kinds of bostons to use the old chinook jargon term for the americans in one particularly petulant passage denny penned that it is a common occurrence for parties who have reached here by the easy method of steamer or railway in a palace car to be most blindly unreason able in their fault finding and they are often not content with abusing the country and climate but they heap curses and abuse on those who came before them by the good old method of ninety or a hundred days crossing the plains denny made a clear distinction between his generation and the bur geoning tide of cheechakos many of whom would go on to become mem bers of the tilikums of elttaes he became increasingly dejected in his public musings about the passing of his generation and the ascendancy of seattle new civic society in an interview with historian hubert howe bancroft for example denny lamented his own obsolescence and seemed to look forward to what he called crossing over even the phys ical evidence of his role as founder of the city had disappeared in the remains of that first log cabin at alki were razed despite dennys efforts to save it denny might have been the father of seattle but he seemed surprisingly lost in the city modern incarnation denny may have been the firstand the most pessimisticseattle pioneer to articulate this anxiety over modern urban life but he was by no means the last major j thomas turner who had first come to seat tle in the s noted in his reminiscences that times have changed not unlike the north american landscape there are no more rocky mountains he wrote no more indians no more buffalo and the great plains have disappeared come to think of it were there ever any or were sic their existence only an iridescent dream meanwhile charles kinnear after describing scenes of s seattle in his own memoirs ended with the acknowledgment that this was in those long haired siwash indian days on what is now the city main waterfront and the like of it cannot be seen here any more similarly edith sander son redfield mourned the passing of seattle wilderness its virgin shore and the race of redmen who lived there in a poem all all are gone the men tepees een gone the trickling streams the trees t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d seattle now in pride surveys its portsits buildingsrailroadsways where money comes and money goes whose right supreme who cares who knows turner kinnear and redfield each linked their history to specific places lost to urban development and filled those places with remembered indians as pioneers told stories about indians and nature to measure what had been lost they produced a placestory that challenged the one told by the tilikums and they knew it pioneer poet francis henry for instance had written in about the pleasant condition of the early settler who was no longer the slave of ambition and who found a new life in the northwest surrounded by acres of clams some years later henry felt compelled to pen a bitter sequel some say this countrys improving and boast of its commerce and trade but measured by social enjoyment i find it has sadly decayed in the pioneer days on the sound when the people had little to wear and subsisted on clams the year round wed hearty good fellowship here not only our friendly relations are dropped for the worship of gold but the solid backbone of the country is recklessly bartered and sold the poem continues with complaints about logging the commercial harvest of those sacred clams and other emblems of industrial puget sound that henry used gold as a metaphor for the lack of friendly relations in the new metropolitan seattle was no accident he and his pioneer compatriots were crafting an urban story that directly challenged the one promoted by the tilikums in the potlatch festivals instead of a story in which the city northern hinterlandand the wealth that had sprung from itwas the driving force pioneers crafted a story in which seattle origins lay in a closeknit community set in a nighedenic landscape the local press also became involved in this clash of urban histo ries in just before the start of the third potlatch festival a writer for the patriarch complained that publicity has developed into a sys tem in the present day that which is not unworthy of publicity is con sidered by the public to be not worth notice the writer then listed all the civic holidays in seattleincluding tilikums day and boost ers daybefore pointing out that the hegira of the pioneers had noth ing to do with gold and that theirs was no featherbed pullman car luxury such as is now enjoyed by those insolent chee charcos who pre sume to treat them with patronizing condescension the tension between potlatch parades and pioneer reunions then reflected a much deeper conflict between the cheechako and the pioneer generations and the social orders they each represented some pioneers had benefited from seattle metropolitan status in fact many of the founding fam ilies had become important members of the civic and commercial elite but in the new cities of the west as historian david wrobel has shown pioneers political and economic power was usually slighteven if their cultural and moral status was notand their accounts of the past con trasted sharply with the efforts of boosters to imagine places like modern seattle into existence as more and more of seattle first settlers died it fell to their chil dren and grandchildren to keep the pioneers placestory alive not sur prisingly the denny clan was at the heart of things in a series of enormously popular books emily inez denny the daughter of david and louisa boren denny and her second cousins sophie frye bass and roberta frye watt the granddaughters of arthur armstrong denny himself equated indians nature and the pioneer way of life more explicitly than their predecessors ever had dennys family mem oir blazing the way or true stories songs and sketches of puget sound and other pioneers is filled with passages in which the first white woman t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d born in seattle grieves for a time when our playgrounds were the brown beaches and the hillsides covered with plumy young fir trees the playground was made all the more wonderful by the friendly advances of native children who in their primitive state seemed perfectly healthy and happy little creatures all this would be swept away by the inexorable tide of progress to the few of our pioneers who are left and who were once the barefooted boys and girls who played the roads that are now first and second avenues the past seems like a beautiful dream wherein people of another world dwelt the red man with his picturesque garb of blankets and beads the pioneer in his buckskin hunting blouse and coon skin cap the sailors from white winged ships and the jolly jack tars from the old manowar dennys beautiful dream contrasted starkly with the urban landscape she now saw around her dennys kinswomen sophie frye bass and roberta frye watt were brought up with tales of seattle village period and like denny told stories about indians to talk about seattle metropolitan transforma tion bass in particular used changes in the urban landscape to distin guish between the indian past and the urban present third street with its neighborly homes beds of pansies and mignonette shade trees picket fences along with the lummei old woman and her micka tickey clams do you want to buy some clams is of yesterday while third avenue with its hurrying throng its roar of traffic and brilliant lights is of today she described the deaths of indigenous people like kikise bloo and the city massive engineering projects in the same sentence she mourned the time before conservation laws when local settlers could come home with bags full of game to talk about urban change it seemed required talking about indians watt followed a similar path in writing of her uncle rolland for example she cast the indian and urban as antonyms his life has spanned the years from the indian cayuse to the automobile from the indian canoe to the airplane he has seen seattle grow and change from one roofless cabin in the wilderness to a city of towering buildings he has seen the winding indian trails give way to straight and paved streets his ears have heard the cry of the cougar the chanting of the medicine man and the voice of the radio in fact in lamenting the loss of the pioneer way of life with its roman tic scenery and encounters with indians the denny women and other pioneers created a framework in which indians and cities seemed as though they were mutually exclusive just as pioneerness seemed impossible in twentiethcentury seattle so too did indianness some even went so far as to equate themselves with the indians who peopled their stories in describing the passing of the settler generation bass described the factors that had led to the dispossession of many real local indiansin particular largescale urban engineeringas if she and her ancestors were a vanishing race as well and when her family home burned in the s she recalled feeling as though i could say with the indians when they were driven from their homes chadquiddelel where is my home using a whulshootseed phrase to express the terror of homelessness in basss urban story pioneers practically were indians the denny family writers mourned the effects of urbanization in particular the perceived loss of community freedom and close ness to natureand used stories about indians to do it but they rarely spoke of the processes by which indigenous land had become seattle for example none of the women mentioned the petition that had prevented the creation of a duwamish reservation near seattle a petition their fathers uncles and grandfathers had all signed instead they emphasized the incalculable injury outrages indigni ties and villainies practiced upon the native inhabitants by evil white men like their ancestors watt bass and denny saw indianwhite hostilities as the fault of the wrong kind of settlers whitewashing both their own past and seattle urban history avoiding the con nections between urban founding native dispossession and metro politan dominance the creators of pioneer placestories absolved themselves of responsibility for both the indigenous past and the urban t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d present it wasnt us they seem to protest it was somebody else the squaw men or those damned cheechakos d espite the contrasting placestories they told and the real differences those stories represented the tilikums and the pioneers had many things in common one of those things was edmond s meany a university of washington his torian meany played a critical role in documenting the local past often in collaboration with pioneer societies but also participated actively in the civic boosterism and cultural borrowing of the tilikums meany con sulted with broadway high school students on a historical pageant that stretched from vancouvers voyage to the creation of the ship canal and the smith tower and he was one of the lead organizers of the aype ensuring that the university of washington would benefit from the development of the fairgrounds he advised tilikums on the proper meaning and use of the term potlatch and regularly answered letters inquiring about indian names for youngbusinessmens clubs high school yearbooks realestate developments and vacation homes meanys life and work blurred the distinctions between potlatcher and pioneer academic and booster archivist and appropriator beyond the tireless professor meany the tilikums and the pioneers had something else in common together they crafted seattle most powerful placestory in which something called the seattle spirit born in the founding at alki point triumphed over both nature and native people this story was transmitted most explicitly on the anniversary of the alki landing known as founders day while founders days in the nineteenth century had been reserved observances by the twenti eth century they had become urban spectacles second only to the pot latches joining memories of indian depredations to calls for a renewed civic consciousness and grafting local stories onto national nar ratives in reenactments and other rituals seattle pilgrims were not just founders of one northwestern city but players in a triumphant drama of civilizationversussavagery that had begun at plymouth rock every november seattleites made their city placestory and their nations placestory one and the same one of the first large public observances of founders day came in hundreds gathered at the corner of first and cherry the site of the blockhouse where settlers had cowered during the indigenous attack on the town in to witness the installation of a plaque commem orating survivors of the battle of seattle pioneer attorney cornelius hanford gave the keynote address describing in vivid detail the san guinary struggle while noting that only a few settlers had been killed in the uprising hanford pointed out that it was an earnest war and waged for the purpose of expelling or exterminating all of the white people but the pioneers had persevered eventually allowing landscapes locked in native possession to achieve their full potential necessity which is natural law justifies the exercise of power of dominant races to occupy and use the land for the purposes for which it is adapted the caucasian race acquired north america partly by purchase and partly by conquest of the native inhabitants who as occupiers of the land failed to use it as god intended that it should be used so as to yield its fruits in abundance for the comfort of millions of inhabitants for hanford and likely for many in the audience that day the connection between indigenous resistance and urban development was clear the former had almost ended but ultimately justified the latter and it was the land this place that joined those two stories in later years han ford would hone this logic in his subscription history seattle and environsalong with books by the denny clan part of seattle historical canonhe wrote that the attack stemmed from indian resentment of a stronger and more enlightened people in the end native envy had faltered before the seattle spirit which had existed from the time when the founders landed intangible as the souls of men and yet a real force giving community identity distinct as the individualities of per sons the birthplace of seattle then was located both at alki point and in race war some observances of seattle birthday were held in public places like the corner of first and cherry others were held in private homes where old friends gathered to share their memories one such gather t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d ing took place in in a proud old house on the top of first hill where the ceilings are high and the roof is mossy and the stairs are square and the light comes through the windows in rainbow patches this was the home of vivian carkeek one of the √©minences grises of seattle society he was a pioneer in fact he had been born in a water front house built on the place where back in david kellogg had watched bunty charleys initiation into a duwamish secret society as founders of the seattle historical society and with links to seattle vil lage period carkeek and his peers crafted a genteel vision of the past but there was also a darker side to that history among the teacakes and crinoline at his party could be found an indian costume or two for grim reminder for all their gentilityor rather because of itpioneers saw themselves as noble survivors of the violent tensions that had dom inated seattle first years one of carkeeks friends wrote for exam ple that as ever the case from massachusetts bay to puget sound the white and red man go to war linking seattle creation to that of the nation pioneers saw their city foundations laid in the inevitability of racial conflict and in the moral fiber that had ensured american vic tory from pawtuxent to the little crossingover place the story seemed the same this vision of civic and national origins was not limited to the pio neers pioneers and potlatchers alike told stories about interracial vio lence as a way to remind modern seattleites of the travails of their forebears abbie dennylindsley one of arthur and mary dennys daughters cautioned in that if modern urban residents could awaken from their uneasy slumbers some night and find seattle as she was fortyfive years ago they would think it a pipe dream and feel for their scalp locks that same year attorney and civic busybody w t dovella candidate for future tilikum membership if ever there was oneechoed dennylindsleys sentiment contrasting the softness of twentiethcentury city life with the grim realities of the frontier where in those days the stranger who struggled to these shores found no warmer welcome than that accorded by the lurking savage who coveted his scalp dovell said in an address later printed in the washington his torical quarterly he is now received into the abiding place of luxury and wealth and at a pioneer reunion mayor john dore warned the younger people present that the race is getting soft but the pio neers lived hard it would be well if you children could understand the hardships these people went through certainly there were other seat tle spirit stories the lost railroadterminus battle with tacoma in the s the imposition of law and order during antichinese violence in the s and the struggle for alaska gateway status in the s but it was the indian challenges of those first years that had the most power and that would continue to reverberate for much of the twenti eth century that power sprang from the resonance between local placestories and the national narrative american thinking about the frontier best articulated by historian frederick jackson turner at the worlds fair in chicago linked the belief in a national character shaped by the frontier experience to concerns about the fate of a nation whose fron tier had just closed just as mayor dore worried about the loss of the seattle spirit americans in general wondered who they were without the twin threats of indians and wilderness meanwhile the indians in seattle stories also looked familiar seeathl was the noble savage par excellence assuaging the guilt of conquest through hospitality and prophecy the big bug and other icons of potlatch reflected fascination with the exotic and ultimately the laughable and primitive and the seat tle spirit drew on the long history of american fear in which the igno ble savage with his tomahawk and shrill war cry skulked in the dim forests of the imagination the creation of stories like these had become a national pastime like countless new local historical societies grand army of the republic reunions and reenactments at plymouth rock seattle potlatches pioneer gatherings and founders days were part of what historian michael kammen has called a new civil religion of historical observance stories about indians created meaning in mod ern america they established pioneers social status in a wealthy new metropolis they voiced dissent regarding environmental and cultural change and ultimately they justified urban conquest and in the years t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d leading up to the second world war seattle placestories went largely unchallenged even by native people themselves d u r i n g t h e y e a r s t h a t the changers transformed seattle indigenous and urban landscapes and crafted civic placestories using indian images few native people resis ted either development in explicit ways the protest by refugees from herrings house on ballast island was a rare exception certainly indigenous people had their own placestories of the city growthchesheeahuds comment about too many houses now for examplebut those stories were almost never told in public instead native men and women often participated in the events through which white placestories were transmitted they were there at the pot latch paddling a canoe against the university of washingtons crew team the indians lost proving yet again according to the post intelligencer that the red man and his handiwork could be no match for the white man and his skill they sometimes came to pioneer gath erings suquamish elder jennie harper for example was brought across puget sound to sit at the head table during rolland dennys final reunion at the stockade hotel and in snohomish elder harriet shelton williams unveiled the new official city seala suspiciously romanlook ing profile of chief seattleon founders day while her father tulalip chief william shelton told stories about seeathl in whulshootseed chi nook jargon and english at events like these indigenous peoples par ticipation seemed only to confirm the civic story meanwhile native people from seattle hinterland lacking the authority that being local bestowed had even less of a voice even at chief seattle day celebrations held on a reservation native people were active participants in observances that told stories serving white urban interests beginning with the first chief seattle day in and continuing through the s the suquamish were gracious hosts to hundreds of visitors from the city decorating seeathls grave coordinating massive clambakes playing the bone game and enter taining with quaint old indians sic songs in formal speeches hered itary chiefs and other tribal leaders spoke of seeathls generosity called for peace between whites and indians and conducted graveside cere monies in doing so they asserted their own ceremonial and political presence but if there was resistance to the seattle placestory embed ded in native participation in chief seattle days no one outside the indigenous community seemed to notice native people surely had their own seattle placestories as historians of other places have shown pri vate stories shared among communities with limited access to public discourse can be the basis for a vibrant alternative historical conscious ness around kitchen tables at winter dances and in tribal council meet ings tribal people surely told their own stories about what seattlethe man and the citymeant from their own perspectives keeping alive their own memories of urban conquest it would be years however before those placestories reached white audiences stories have a past they come from somewhere stories also perform work when they are told they enact power seattle placestories both reflected and reinforced the city patterns of power as illustrated by two final potlatch stories leon metcalf who spent many years recording the stories of puget sound indian people saw firsthand the power of seat tles urban narrative late in his life he recalled attending the golden potlatch of where the big bug and the tilikums commanded the thoroughfares where totem poles decorated downtown and where indigenous people were among the throngs my father and i were walk ing across a street after the parade had gone past he told an interviewer but there was still lot of racket it was very loud there were two indian women probably duwamish indians that were there selling clams and baskets prob ably one turned to the other and i listened to hear what she was going to say what she said was we are making noise it was kind of a pun a play on words on her part from our perspective almost a century later it is hard not to see the duwamish womans whulshootseed wordplay as a sardonic reference to the extravagant chaos that the tilikums had orchestrated or perhaps even as a protest against the public silence of local indigenous people in civic discourse in a city that used indian images and stories to make t h e c h a n g e r s c h a n g e d sense of itself real native people and especially those not affiliated with totem poles were pushed to the margins of urban society they now had little impact on the shape of seattle urban narrativeexcept maybe as metaphors more than two decades later in snohomish elder harriet williams fondly recalled the potlatches and expressed hope that more would be held in the future i have a jumbled but happy memory of seattle potlatchwalking along avenues full of many shopsmany people and the hum of many voicesthe thrill of watching various drill teams and bands march with perfect precision so many beautiful floats the result of thought and work yes i had a most enjoyable time like skagit shamans visiting the optometrist plains warriors on the aype ferris wheel or haida assemblyline workers williamss mem ories of potlatch reminded readers that native people so often relegated to seattle urban past were also part of seattle urban present but as she continued williams also drew attention to all that had been lost but i somehow still long for those past daysi can see the approach of count less canoes the sounds of drums and the rhythms of different chantsmy own language which i hear so seldom now but such is progressand so the indian of today brings his dollars and cents to potlatch and receives various pleasures in returnand hopes seattle will keep on having potlatch by the s this kind of imagethe sweeping away of the city complicated past and most of its indians before a crushing wave of metaphors marketing and metropolishad become received wisdom and common knowledge but just as tides come in they rush out again and williamss words were spoken on the eve of a new era in seattle complicated native histories in which the placestories told in seattle and the people doing the telling would change yet again the woven coast a visitor to seattle in the summer of would have been impressed where a town of fewer than four thousand people had existed only twenty years earlier a city of eighty thousand now crowded the shores of elliott bay a newly commissioned army fort guarded the bluffs above west point a mas sive railroad and shipping terminal was under construction at smiths cove and electric lights illuminated much of downtown powered by distant dams more than forty labor unions represented workers in the city including the longshoremen who shepherded millions of dollars in international commerce into and out of elliott bay the duwamish river still curved chaotically toward the sound but its meandering days were numbered plans were already under way to transform it into an organized channel of commerce even ballast island where the refugees from herrings house had come to protest seven years before seemed to reflect seattle urban fortunes growing each year as bricks rocks and other detritus were added by ships from manila honolulu val paraiso san francisco and sydney metropolis had arrived but in it was not the people of herrings house who now camped on ballast island instead it was people from the strait of juan de fuca these were sklallam people thirteen dozen men women and children who had come to the city from their homeland on the northern shore of the olympic peninsula their canoes and those of other native people from even more distant native places had inspired some observers to dub seattle waterfront the venice of the pacific sklallam people camped safely in the territory of the duwamish clearly the city indian terrain had shifted meanwhile several blocks away on the site of henry yeslers old mill a second kind of new indian terrain existed on a triangle of greensward known as pioneer place park wedged in among the banks and hotels a massive tlingit carving rose over flowerbeds and a neatly clipped lawn at its base mythic ancestor ravenattheheadofnass anchored a series of striking figures a whale with a seal in its mouth a smaller raven a mink a woman holding her frogchild and yet another raven carrying a crescent moon in its beak this was the chiefofallwomen pole carved to memorialize a woman who had lived and died a thousand miles from seattle it was an unlikely candidate for the city first piece of public art but there it stood according to one observer it even made seattle unique the only city in the world which possesses a monument of this character to a fast departing race the story of how canoes from the strait of juan de fuca and a totem pole from alaska got to seattle is the story of the city arrival as a regional metropolis of the linking of distant places to each other and to that metropolis and of the creation of a new urban story just as ballast island was a physical manifestation of seattle connections to distant ports indian people and images in seattle reflected the city new economic and cultural boundaries which by the twentieth century reached as far north as alaska indian canoes arriving on seattle waterfront from far flung places heralded the creation of an urban indian hinterland of which seattle was one nexus meanwhile seattle experience of regional empire spurred in part by the discovery of gold in the klondike in led to a new urban vocabulary that used native imagery such as totem poles to highlight the city new position as gateway to the north seat tles indian hinterland stretched along a coast woven together by new urban and indigenous connections and through that new weaving both native people and the city would be changed i n august the seattle daily intelligencer reported that scores of native men and women were camped at the foot of washington street on their way to the hop fields of rural puget sound country perhaps they were the people immortalized in mr glovers birds eye panorama of the city if not they were people like them above the tide line temporary shelters and dozens of canoes filled with personal belongings turned the waterfront into a sudden and unmistakable indian neighborhood the paper predicted that after three or four weeks earn ing considerable money from labor in the fields the indians will then return on their way stopping at seattle to spend the larger part of their earnings the movement of working indian peopleand not insignificantly their moneyin and out of seattle was becoming part of the city urban calendar and a central facet of life in native com munities far beyond puget sound canoes from washingtons pacific coast the islands and inlets of british columbia and as far north as alaska were more than just modes of conveyance toward economic opportunity they were vehicles in which indian people traveled toward a new identity crafted through their encounters with the urban long before hops and cities reoriented native lives on the northwest coast indigenous people had come from great distances to visit puget sound in the s archaeologists working on the site of a new sewage treatment plant at west point in seattle found two remarkable pieces of carved stone one worked from dark green nephrite and the other hollowed out of light gray stone these were labrets ornaments that had once pierced the lower lips of elite native people the green one even bore scratches where it had rubbed against the teeth of its wearer they were at least three thousand years old and their origins lay far to the north no societies south of the central british columbian coast had ever worn them while the labrets are a mystery were they worn by men or women slaves or invaders spouses or traders they attest to ancient voyages along the vast edge of a continent stories of such journeys come from shallower time as well during the same decades that vancouver and wilkes explored the northwest coast for their empires indigenous people with their own ambitions were making thousandmile journeys in fortyfoot canoes to the places that would become seattle shilshole elders for example told one local historian of raids by stikine tlingit from southeast alaska those unable to escape into the backcountry around tucked away inside were either taken as slaves or killed their heads thrown into salmon bay the lekwiltok kwakwakawakw of the northern strait of georgia had earned a similar a reputation in puget sound by the s their raids t h e w o v e n c o a s t appearing in the oral traditions of both peoples even after nonindian settlement in puget sound these northern indians described by set tlers as northern british indians or even britishrussia redskins to distinguish them from local indigenous people continued to make forays into the inland waterways near seattle sometimes turning their attentions to white schooners and farms but in the late nineteenth century the nature and frequency of native visits to puget sound and seattle changed drawn by seasonal work in the regions burgeoning economy indian men women and children began traveling huge distances often every year to seattle and its out lying areas as puget sounds first largescale agricultural commodity hops played the largest role in these migrations but over time other kinds of cropsberries vegetables herbs flowersdemanded native labor for tribal communities all along the coast occasional forays into puget sound became regular peregrinations by the early twentieth cen tury the city was a wellestablished stopover for indian laborers whose home communities ranged up and down the northwest coast canoes going to and from seattle changed both their home com munities and the city the most obvious effects were monetary indi ans fresh from the hop fields and other jobs injected large sums of money into seattle economy one seattle newspaper noted in for exam ple that native visitors brought great trade to the city merchants and that between their calls going and returning they will leave sev eral thousand dollars in seattle native shoppers in seattle quickly estab lished a reputation for shrewdness with one paper referring to them as sharp close traders who look upon the bostons with a suspicious eye according to some observers indians spending made them prefer able to other minorities in the city one paper reported that they were better than chinese immigrants as they spend the money they receive and keep it in the country instead of hoarding it and shipping it to a for eign land from whence no dollar returns while not on a par with tourist dollars or largescale capital investmentsparticularly in later decades as the urban economy reached metropolitan proportionsindian cash nonetheless helped to fill urban coffers things bought in seattle could be used to maintain native traditions in the hinterland as the purchase of material goods in seattle and other urban centers meshed with indigenous notions of prestige one observer for example noted that it was a common thing to see sev eral sewing machines in one indian house or half a dozen phonographs and beds and tables by the dozen but never used if by chance the owner of the house should die to ease his condition in the next world all these household goods were piled upon his grave often including the very doors and window sashes of his house goods procured in urban placesphonographs and bedsteads as well as more mundane resources like flour and coffeehelped maintain and even augment indigenous institutions like the potlatch sometimes the potlatches important ceremonies in which natives displayed their wealth reaffirmed their status and cemented kinship and community ties were even held in seattle orange jacobs recalled one such event in the s when a canadian indian named jim gave away hundreds of dollars worth of blankets calico suits of clothing and indian trinkets to dozens of participants on the tidelands south of town even the journey itself could be a display of status pacheenaht chief charles jones once boasted that he had paddled from vancouver island to seattle in a single day the urban experience did not necessarily erode indigenous traditions it could in fact strengthen them this was perhaps especially true for native people whose homes were in british columbia where the potlatch was outlawed beginning in casting ones lot with the vagaries of the american agricultural econ omy however brought risks for travelers and those they left behind one canadian indian agent noted in for example that seattle bound tsimshians had failed to obtain much labour and realized but little profit likewise kweeha kwakwakawakw charles nowell recalled one season when he his brother and some inlaws stayed in seattle for only two or three days after learning that hops were all burnt and returned home virtually broke labor gluts and disasters like the hop louse infestations of the s could wreak havoc with native fortunes in some unlucky sheshahts from vancouver island were forced to spend the winter digging clams and selling them in seattle for mea ger returns because of losses earlier in the season meanwhile migrants t h e w o v e n c o a s t absences could leave their kin vulnerable on remote reserves an agent on eastern vancouver island reported in the late s that cowichan elders faced hardship as younger relatives spurned local subsistence activities to pursue wealth elsewhere but perhaps the greatest challenge posed by annual migrations came from disease economic vectors between seattle and its native hinter land were mirrored by biological vectors pathways where contagion trav eled with the phonographs and cash those vectors had helped fuel seattle city leaders racist paranoia in the s but if the paranoia had mostly ended by the last years of the nineteenth century the continu ing effects of such diseases had not in fact the prevalence of measles tuberculosis and other illnesses among native travelers allows us to locate them in the urban landscape death records for king county dur ing the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries show clusters of indian mortality among the tidelands and shanties near the old lava beds canoes lay at the foot of weller street for example while their owners and passengers died just blocks away the diseases went home with the survivors indian agents on vancouver island were especially aware of the illnesses that struck communities whose members had gone to town in agent harry guillod reported that many kyu quot and chickleset children had died of measles on the way back to vancouver island from the sound while the hesquiaht who had stayed home had been spared two months later the provinces indian super intendent reported that the same outbreak was now raging everywhere on the british columbia coast hundreds of miles from urban centers native cemeteries bore the marks of diseases that blossomed in crowded cities migration to and from seattle had its more subtle costs as well erod ing connections to indigenous places in the hinterland among the tlin git for example the central element of social life the kw√°an or clan was a map of sorts a linkage between a group of people and a place expressed through subsistence activities and oral tradition through rela tionships with urban places however these intimate connections between people and place were shifting charlie jim sr or t√≥ok a hut snuwu tlingit raven who often came to the city told a biographer that in the early twentieth century he sometimes felt like a man without a country because of his regular movements between southeast alaska and seattle for someone who defined himself in large part by his kw√°an and thus his place this was a telling statement his story likely not unique suggests that while the coast was being woven together in some ways it was being sundered in others for all its risks though migration to seattle and puget sound gave native people a chance at independence and presented challenges to federal indian policies in both the american and the canadian parts of the northwest coast treaties with washington state and the rules of the reserve system in british columbia allowed for the movement of native people off of reservations and reserves but it often seemed to agents that such travel undermined efforts to civilize native people from the makah reservation for instance whole families headed to the hop fields leaving agency schools empty bibles unread and les sons unlearned makah daniel quedessa wrote to a white friend in the s that he would soon leave with his parents to go to pick hops adding that i guess every one of the school childrens will go up to pick hops meanwhile canadian missionaries across the strait of juan de fuca found it very uphill work persuading families to stay on the reserve during the school year when work and wages beckoned from the south native travel to seattle thwarted the larger goals of national policies much as it had in earlier periods of seattle history as before efforts to define who belonged where rarely worked out as planned for all the agents complaints though canoe trips to seattle actu ally helped native people integrate themselves into settler society few extant sources indicate how native people perceived places like seat tle but it appears that for some encounters with urban life inspired new cosmopolitan ambitions it is likely that many found the material abundance social opportunities and general spectacle of seattle an excit ing change of pace many native men and women may have agreed with tsimshian arthur wellington clah who simply called seattle a great city in his diary others seem to have aspired to an urban ity of their own on vancouver islands west coast one sign of prestige at the turn of the century was a home sporting bay windows and vic t h e w o v e n c o a s t torian fretwork emulating houses seen in seattle and elsewhere the urban experience left subtle marks on communities hundreds of miles from the city itself both augmenting traditions like the potlatch and inspiring a new cosmopolitan indianness over time the attractions of the city even inspired some native people to become longerterm residents spending more than the summer months in seattle in for example a group of kyuquot families chose to winter over and dig clams to sell in the city meanwhile an indian couple from an unidentified northwest coast community worked as fiery baptist missionaries in seattle in the first years of the twentieth century attracted by the souls that needed saving on what was left of the old lava beds among the makah living in seattle for varying lengths of time became a normal part of life in the s neah bay was almost deserted in the summers as people went to the city and the hop fields and some did not come back at all in fact seattle had become so central to makah economic life that daniel quedessa lamented in that i can not even go to seattle for a trip i cant go some place for week so i stay here in neah bay on the makah reser vation all the time thats why i dont make money i always wishing if i could go away and make little money for many of the makah seat tle had become an indispensable part of getting by and for some it was becoming a home in its own right coming to seattle meant that native people from the city hinter land sometimes came into contact with local indigenous people suquamish elder amelia sneatlum for example recalled the time in the early twentieth century when her family was camping on the beach at seattle and a yakama man stabbed and nearly killed her father at the other end of the spectrum muckleshoot elder art williams described friendly encounters with native migrants on elliott bay which were facil itated by the use of chinook jargon and in later years english at the same time the erosion of indigenous communities in and immediately around seattle also provided openings for migrants from the hinter land the sheshahts who stayed in town to dig clams for example could do so because many indigenous duwamish families with traditional rights to those beds had moved to area reservations or given up clam ming the growth of one kind of native presence in seattle then existed in a sort of inverse relationship with another kind of native presence at least until the clam beds were destroyed altogether by urban change meanwhile a new kind of urban indian history was on the rise as native people arrived in seattle in canoes and more commonly in the twentieth century on steamers they entered a city with a new vocab ulary throughout the city totem poles and other native symbols drawn from the very same hinterland places whence the travelers had come marked shop fronts and street corners if the movement of indian people to and from the city had changed both the native hinterland and its urban center the movement of indian things had also changed both places as well providing a new iconography of urban empire s ometime near the close of the eighteenth century a tlingit noblewoman of the ganax√°di raven clan chiefofall women drowned in the nass river while on her way to com fort an ill relative after lengthy and heartfelt mourning rituals clan members in her community of on the cottonwood on tongass island in southeast alaska hired a carver to commemorate her life and her heritage drawing on ancient stories of ravenattheheadofnass and other figures associated with her lineage the carver produced a fifty foot cedar pole that was erected next to the clans longhouse for more than nine decades the chiefofallwomen pole with the dead womans cremated remains inside it reminded the tongass tlingit of ganax√°di origins and social standing then in a group of men from seattleamong them clergy men land developers and bankersarrived at on the cottonwood on a ship chartered by the seattle postintelligencer coming ashore to see the totem poles and longhouses of the tlingit community up close they were particularly taken by the chiefofallwomen pole thinking it would make a fine souvenir of their journey to alaskaand later claim ing that the village was desertedthe men sawed through the pole at its base discarded chiefofallwomens remains and floated the pole out to their ship breaking off the beak of ravenattheheadofnass in the process t h e w o v e n c o a s t several weeks later on october the chiefof allwomen pole was erected in pioneer place park a spot of sod at the heart of seat tles first plats all day long people paused and gazed went away returned and gazed again crowed the triumphant postintelligencer and said it was a great and wonderful thing and a grand acquisition to the city in a fit of victorian flourish another observer gave voice to the pole itself i am the only civilized totem pole on earth and civilization suits me well while all the others of my kind are slowly settling on their stems among the salmon scented silences sequestered from the sight of man here in seattle surging scenes i stand incomparable so heres farewell to all my past and welcome to the things that are with you henceforth my die is cast ive hitched my wagon to a star and by the sacred frog that hops and by the bird that flies and by the whale and the bear i sunder all the ties that bound me to the ancient creed which holds my people flat and i will be a totem pole that knows where it is at abandoning its backward creators the chiefofallwomen pole now served a higher purpose advertising seattle where it was at among the city surging scenes and far from the salmon scented silences seemed not only preferable but natural seattle knew where it was at as well at the dawn of the twentieth century it was the gateway to a new empire that stretched from its railroad stations and wharves along the rainy northwestern edge of north america and into the high arc tic just as native people moved up and down the coast native objects and images began to move as well and both seattle and its hinterland were changed here was a city that highlighted its urban modernity by telling stories about places far from the bustle about silent places in the distant wilderness over which it held sway as early as the alaska times was being published in seattle but it was the arrival of the steamer portland in that truly hitched seattle wagon to the norths star soon after the portland hove to on the waterfront with half a ton of yukon gold on board seattle estab lished itself as a fulcrum in the economy and ecology of gold a cru cible that turned raw yellow metal into cash food clothing real estate patronage and more while other developments helped spur the eight fold expansion of the seattle economy between and steamship trade with asia and south america as well as increases in commercial rail shipping to markets back east the gold rush became the dominant explanation for seattle new international prominence as the launching point for voyages to alaska seattle became an entre p√¥t not just for yellow metal but for encounters with the native peoples of the north anthropologists had been working the coast for years but the massive migration of nonindian people diseases technologies and goods into seattle northern hinterland quickened the scramble for northwest coast materials and gave rise to a salvage mentality among scholars anthropologists came to document cultures that seemed on the verge of extinction tourists came in search of exotic others who called the northern wilderness home most of them came from seat tle particularly after its status as the commercial center of the gold rush was clinched and were encouraged along their way by guidebooks printed by railroads steamship companies and seattle own cham ber of commerce native people and things along with the spectacu lar scenery of the inside passage were the chief attractions of trips from seattle to alaska as early as naturalist john muir described mobs of totemseeking tourists on the waterfront at wrangell alaska there was a grand rush on shore to buy curiosities and see totem poles he wrote the shops were jammed and mobbed high prices being paid for shabby stuff manufactured expressly for the tourist trade and once t h e w o v e n c o a s t seattle had established itself as the gateway city tourists need not go as far as wrangell to purchase a piece of the north ye olde curiosity shop opened in by j e daddy standless among the steamer wharves of the waterfront and still in business today became a nexus of the trade in native material culture and the greatest of dozens of such emporia in seattle in addition to outfitting indian corners in private homes the curiosity shop and its competitors helped fill the american museum of natural history and the field museum curio shops were places where popular imagination ethnographic impulses and urban ambitions joined but the movement of native thingssuch as the miniature argillite totem poles ivory shamans tools and cedar canoe models at the curiosity shopfrom seattle hinterland was made possible by native people just as indian men and women met the throngs at wrangells wharves they also worked at the heart of the trade in seattle one such man was sam williams a ditidaht carver from vancouver island first coming to seattle around the turn of the cen tury williams settled on the tideflats like so many other migrants and in his skills came to the attention of daddy standless over the next four decades williams carved hundreds of miniature and fullsize totem poles for the curiosity shop several of williamss children and grandchildren also carved for standless and a handful of his poles can still be found at the curiosity shop the chiefofallwomen pole erected in pioneer place park at the height of the gold rush was the most famous example of this migra tion of native objects and imagery it instantly became an icon of seat tles promise and one of the mustsee attractions of excursions to the northwest in the april journal of american folklore anthropolo gist john swanton wrote every visitor to seattle washington has been attracted and more or less interested by the great totem pole that adorns its main square as its image circulated around the globe on cartes des visites seattle totem pole provided a frontierish frisson that set the city apart from its competitors indeed the chiefofallwomen pole was all the more exceptional because of its urban backdrop this totem pole is such a curious object wrote one observer to her massachusetts kin in especially when seen right in the business part of the city as ours is in temperance writer agnes lockhart hughes cast the pole as a zerodatum marker for the city growth for less than a decade of years this heraldic monument has gazed upon the many changes in its vicinity and shortly on all sides it will be overshad owed by the immense business structures now in the course of construc tion relentlessly the hands of a nearby clock mark the speed of fleeting time seemingly unmindful of the grotesque totem pole its lips tell nothing of its past its ears are deaf to the roar of traffic around it but its eyes gaze down on the rapid progress of seattle the wonderful queen city of the west for observers like hughes the pole in pioneer place linked the banks law firms and other businesses of the city commercial districtmany of which fronted the park where the pole stoodwith the goldfields and other resources of the new alaskan frontier the fact that the pole faced northwest was deliberate a trophy of the gold rush boom the chiefofallwomen pole became a symbol of seattle metropolitan reach and thus its modernity other imperial cities had created visual languages to reflect their ambitions and the nature of their holdings seattle had looked north and found a totem pole like indian migration to and from seattle represented by canoes on the waterfront the hinterland represented by the chiefofall women pole was manifested in comings and goings a canoe cap sized in the nass river inspiring the carving of a pole a chartered ship dropped anchor at tongass island its passengers hungry for a trophy while steamboats spilled tourists onto wharves in search of alaskan sou venirs railcars emptied at seattle stations to be filled again with masks and rattles on their way to eastern museums lines on tourist brochures linked seattle with alaskan places like wrangell and sitka urbanites took the trolley downtown to see a pole erected and postcards traveled the world naming seattle gateway to the north and city of totems through routes of travel and commerce that linked places like on the cottonwood to places like pioneer place park indian images came unmoored and could serve new masters t h e w o v e n c o a s t this was a powerful new placestory literally the creation of seat tles new urban vocabulary carried with it new power relations within months after the chiefofallwomen pole was taken in for exam ple the tlingit people of on the cottonwood accused eight of the post intelligencer expedition members of theft seeing little cause for concern the committee of eight filed a mock suit against themselves bring ing lake indian chesheeahud from his home on lake union to play the role of plaintiff that ploy was dropped when a federal grand jury indicted the committee but the presiding judge soon dismissed the indictment after a dinner held in his honor by committee members drafting a retroactive bill of sale the committee paid to the people of tongass island and then sat back to bask in their newfound notori ety the ganax√°di ravens and the seattleites had been connected to each other in new and unexpected ways in an urban warp and indige nous weft that bound up a continents vast edge t he klondike gold rush symbolized seattle imperial education the alaskayukonpacific exposition was its coming out party held in on the shores of lake washington the aype trumpeted seattle status as queen city of the pacific and its massive beaux artsstyle buildings made mostly of plaster stood as symbols of the awakening of the pacific and transforming of the backyard of the world into the front the neoclassical white city con fections impressed visitors but so did the presence of japalaskan architecture and other indianinspired spectacles especially on the amusement strip known as the pay streak the red man of the pacific coast is present everywhere announced the seattle times his crude art always symbolical and sometimes hideous glares and grins at the visitor from the red and duncolored totem poles marking the way to the pay streak the carved tribal history of alaskan tribes upholds the beautiful tori arch of the south gate and figures in many of the post cards sold by dealers in such wares beyond the pay streak indian things filled the displays of the fair seattle photographer edward s curtiss photogravures sklallam ceremonial objects even human scalps recalling the red man of j fenimore cooper in the govern ment buildings dead letter department virtually every exhibit included some sort of ethnographic display and the message was clear these indians were our peoplenot in the sense of being us of course but in the sense of being ours like other worlds fairs the aype was intensely didactic brazenly ambitious and thoroughly racist for all the power of curtiss photos and the titillation of scalps and grotesques it was the display of actual native people that most capti vated the attention of seattle fairgoers the most popular attraction of the entire exposition was the eskimo village on the pay streak where expert reindeer men skinboat builders ivory carvers and the best look ing women most of them from siberia served as living examples of primitivism as they undertook everyday activities in their plaster frozen north meanwhile indian schoolchildren from tulalip were put on dis play to show what the bureau of indian affairs has accomplished for the indian people during the last few years and just outside the fair grounds at the white city amusement park cheyenne arapaho and lakota men attacked stagecoaches day after day as part of a wild west show only to be rebuffed every time by white gunslingers whether as harmless primitives emblems of assimilation or violent barbarians native people like native things were used by fair organizers to artic ulate a clear message witness our realm see our burdens it is all too easy to see native people at the aype as mere captives to seattle imperial fantasies to some extent they were but at the same time native people had their own reasons to go to the fair two days after arriving in seattle to tend reindeer at the eskimo village for exam ple i√±upiat oliver angolook decided to return to his community near nome when the agent who had procured his services confronted him at the wharf angolook was reported to respond got money pay my own fare indeed angolooks salary was reportedly enough to keep an entire family in affluence through several seasonsand ironically it provided the means for him to leave seattle altogether similarly many indian wild west show participants saw such performances as a way to visit faraway places while earning money for displays of traditional skills like horsemanship still another performer the eskimo belle known as columbia reaped a more unique reward after winning the t h e w o v e n c o a s t aype beauty contest trouncing several white competitors the young labrador inuit woman received a lot in one of seattle new suburbs like hop fields or curio shops the aype was an opportunity mean while skhandoo a chilkoot tlingit shaman wowed audiences with dances and ceremonies at the eskimo village alongside other tlingits of the chilkat hoonah and taku bands he had once earned great wealth thanks to the otter spirit that gave him power to heal harm and see faroff events but after two prison terms for deaths caused by his ministrations he found himself destitute until landing the job at the worlds fair for skhandoo the aype served two purposes it allowed him to continue performing the work for which he had received prestige from both tlingit and white observers and it provided him with a living for a man in skhandoos tenuous position participation in the aype may have been the best of few options for all these native people coming to the fair like coming to the city more generally often simply made good economic sense seattle fair was also a place to play out longstanding rivalries between indigenous communities in early for instance fair organ izers received a telegram from harry hobucket a quileute from wash ingtons outer coast noting that the rival makah were having trouble acquiring a gray whale to bring to the fair and offering to bring one on behalf of the quileute while exposition organizers appear to have declined the offer the proposal suggests that some native people saw the fair as an opportunity to shame old enemies in a new setting with a huge audience several weeks later a challenge came from chief taho lah of the quinault and his subchief pekanim of the hoh to indians everywhere and especially to their old enemies to join in a canoe race at the fair but such competitions like the canoe races on sep tember seattle day could also facilitate new alliances among tribal communities as teams from washingtons skokomish and tulalip reservations and british columbias lyacksun and penelekuts reserves attracted thousands of spectators to the shores of lake union they both drew white approval and helped craft a shared native identity at least one native group came to seattle explicitly to resist white authority these were the tsimshian of metlakatla a christian settle ment founded in by the missionary william duncan who sought to isolate the tsimshian from outside influences many tsimshian people saw this isolation as a barrier to opportunity and began to rebel against duncans authority and by various american governmental bod ies had gotten involved as tsimshians and others complained to the department of interior and the alaskan educational authorities while the metlakatlan contributions to the faira brass band and a ladies auxiliary known for its needlepointwere portrayed as the products of civilizing efforts several tsimshian fairgoers were in fact trying to oust the man seeking to civilize them the auxiliary president for exam ple was mrs bertrand mitchell whose husband was in the midst of a campaign against duncan writing to alaska school commissioners we are slaves here we are getting poorer all the time and mr duncan is getting richer what is the matter with the government meanwhile william pollard assistant leader of the brass band had also vocally opposed duncans rule needlepoint and rousing marches then were a way for tsimshian people to join the outside world coming to the aype was an act of resistance finally native people also came to the fair as fullfledged spectators taking in the urban spectacle like everyone else the postintelligencer reported that indian observers at the canoe races for example put the organized yells of some rah rah boys completely to shame meanwhile several lakota wild west show performers and their families decked out in all the picturesque attire of the cow countrysombreros chaps and all the rest of it went to the pay streak one afternoon for fun and encountered a group of flathead indians to the uninitiated it looked as if a real war whoop was the next thing to be expected winked the times but then the chief of the rosebuds gave a guttural command and his braves lined up in single file and slowly approached a similar file which formed on the instant among the flatheads for fifteen min utes the warriors of the two tribes shook hands silently not a word was passed between them and there was never a smile until the ceremony was over and then they fraternized as if they had come from the same reservation the two groups then went to visit the eskimo village where they showed the siberians the tlingit shaman skhandoo the eskimo t h e w o v e n c o a s t belle columbia and the gawking crowds what a war dance is like when danced among friends then the lakotas and flatheads finished the day with a ride on the ferris wheel we cannot know what the indians on the ferris wheel thought of the eskimo village the baby incubators the upside down house or the temple of palmistry native people probably found the aype awe inspiring offensive hilarious and perhaps even boring but they may also have seen deeper meanings for themselvesa wild west show as a mark of prestige an invitation to the pay streak as a gesture of friend ship a war dance among friends as a step toward a shared native iden tity as the center of a vast regional empire seattle had become an important venue in which to pursue old and new native ambitions not only did canoes represent indian migration to and from the city but when paddled in aype races they also signified the development of a shared native identity totem poles represented not only seattle impe rial claims on the north but also the people who traveled to the city in pursuit of economic independence social status or a good show while on its surface a spectacle of urban dominance and white racial superiority the alaskayukonpacific exposition also reflected the ambitions of its native participants who came from the far ends of seat tles hinterland on their own terms o ne of the most striking photos in any of seattle archives dates from the first years of the twentieth cen tury taken by an unnamed photographer in front of the frederick and nelson department store at the corner of second and madison it captures a native woman likely makah or nuu chahnulth sitting against the buildings stone fa√ßade and selling bas kets blankets and other handicrafts she looks ahead and slightly down avoiding the gaze of a welldressed white woman who leans over her with an iassumeyoucantspeakenglishsoilltalklouder expres sion a third woman of indeterminate race possibly indian watches the exchange as busy urbanites rush by among them a particularly dowdy older woman who seems to observe the scene with disdain it is a moment of encounter where women of different races and classes came together for a moment on the streets of the city to haggle over a basket weaving was not just a metaphor for what happened on this coast like canoes and totem poles baskets were both product and symbol of seattle indian hinterland throughout the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century sidewalk encounters between indian vendors and white customers were a part of everyday life in seattle one news paper article might have been describing this very photo uptown on first and second avenues many an important corner was given a touch of nature by the presence of a wrinkled old squaw leaning her toil bent back against the supporting columns while around are arrayed canoes and baskets and mats in reckless profusion all ready to be traded for the money of whites travel correspondent nina alberta arndt described the ubiquity of similar touches of nature in the overland monthly three years later noting that indian women and their wares could be found upon the steps of the principal banks on the sidewalks of the business thoroughfares or again in the aisles of some depart ment store local newspapers identified indians squatting in char acteristic attitudes with hiyu iktas many things spread around them as one of the most common sights along the pavements of seattle intruding itself on the vision of every pedestrian meanwhile more eager seekers of curios could visit native encampments on filled land south of the city no need to go to neah bay prince rupert or sitka the hinterland came to seattle bringing touches of distant nature to the heart of urban america and in fact most of the basket vendors on seattle streets at the turn of the century were not from puget sound according to the postintelligencer many were makah or nuuchahnulth from vancouver island and her baskets designs suggest that the woman in the frederick and nelsons photo was as well an agent among the sheshahts at port alberni on vancouver island confirmed that many seattle vendors were his charges during the winter months the women often engage in the manufacture of baskets which being a distinct novelty are readily disposed of in the larger towns in the state of washington like canoes and totem poles baskets connected seat t h e w o v e n c o a s t tle street corners to native communities hundreds of miles from the city eastern tourists to seattle often saw a basket or other indian curio as the requisite souvenir of a trip to the city meaning that a sheshaht basket could easily end up in boston or london or st louis indeed for some native vendors eastern customers were preferable accord ing to one seattle paper an indian curioshop manager at the corner of a seattle block can tell an easterner from a western product he knows the cheechaco a sale with an eastern tourist is easily landed and prob ably a hundred percent on the real value is assessed at that the sale of baskets then drew attention to the boundaries not just between white and indian but between westerner and easterner captured best in the chinook jargon word cheechako literally meaning newly arrived but also glossed as both easterner and greenhorn baskets linked places to each other but also differentiated places as well distinguishing seat tle and its people from their eastern counterparts here was a city where native nature could be acquired without venturing into actual wilder ness and where urban america had an indian edge gullible easterners were not the only collectors of baskets however throughout seattle in places socially if not physically distant from the tideflat encampments and street corners white women added baskets and other items to curio corners a postintelligencer article describ ing the best collections in town reads like a clipping from the society page the wives of mill owners and other civic elites all had extensive collections carrie burke married to a judge even had a new wing added to her house specifically for her indian collection in fine homes on the hills of seattle such as the frye mansion at ninth and columbia upper class white women used the collection of indian things to mark their own social status just as totem poles spoke of seattle metropolitan status cedar bark and maidenhair fern from vancouver island could help a bankers wife in seattle tell stories about privilege and power and showed how tightly the urban center and indigenous periphery were woven together along the coast that seattle dominated this was a new kind of imbrication different from the landscape mr glover had hinted at with his birdseye sketch of seattle the treaties had been signed for fifty years the indigenous towns had long been burned kikisebloo had died a decade earlierand yet indian people remained a highly visible part of seattle urban landscape but instead of the whulshootseed word yiq these people might have used other words to describe the process of imbricating themselves into seat tles landscape taken from their own languages words for weaving like the quileute tsikbay the sklallam ekwel and the kwakwala yep√° or words for worrying into tight places like the tlingit dikeek or the nuuchahnulth pithlqa and as the indigenous languages spoken in seattle had changed so had the city civic vocabulary croaking amid the urban din of pioneer square ravenattheheadofnass told a place story of transformation but he was not alone like mrs burke displaying her baskets seattle civic leaders had found new ways to talk about the city and its past inspired by the memory of urban conquest and the creation of a regional hinterland the city leaders set about crafting a new set of placestories that cut to the very heart of what it meant to be white american and of this place t h e w o v e n c o a s t city of the changers w hen llie wilbur was a little girl living on the cusp of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the horse and buggy ride from the muckleshoot reservation to seattle was a long one and in her words awful you knowhave to go uphill downhill wed all get off and walk even so her family went every year to visit her grandmothers brother who lived in a ramshackle floating house near the mouth of the duwamish seetoowathlor old indian george as his neighbors called himstill lived where he had been born in a place known in his language sim ply as tideflats he shared the house with his wife who was either quite insane or the meanest old depending on whom you talked to and he made a living by catching dogfish and rendering their oil for local sawmills thats all he does is fish the old man ollie recalled the monotony of fishing was broken every september when ollie and her parents came with canned berries from the foothills their jour ney linked seetoowathl who refused to speak english with visiting ethno graphers and his prickly wife to a reservation some thirty miles distant long past the treaty and the battle of seattle indigenous people whose ancestors once lived in duwamish shilshole and lake communities like little crossingover place and herrings house still lived in seat tle even as many of their kin found homes far from the city between and however forces were at work that would make indigenous survival in seattle virtually impossible during those years the city saw its most explosive period of urban growth which spelled disaster for native people trying to live in traditional ways and places by the s in fact indigenous seattlethe geographies and communities that predated the founding of the citywould come to an end even if indian seattle would not the wholesale transforma tion of the urban landscape dramatically altered indigenous subsistence practices and created a new placestory in which the vanishing race and the ghostly indian haunting the city were selffulfilling prophecies the indian people who remained in seattle meanwhile became almost invisible as they adapted to life in a new metropolis according to oral tradition seeathl had seen this change coming during treaty negotiations in he had warned his people to pay spe cial attention to the americans and their government you folks observe the changers who have come to this land he told those gathered you folks observe them well in calling the americans changers seeathl invoked the figure of dookweebathl the changer who had organized the chaotic landscape of deep time and made the world habitable for the human people it was a particularly apt choice of terms as powerful forces reshaped seattle in the decades around the turn of the century indigenous people found themselves caught up in a transformation of their world nearly as dramatic as those described in the ancient stories by seattle had become the city of a new kind of changers a t first glance seattle two most important fires seem unrelated the first in utterly destroyed the city com mercial district the second four years later obliterated sev eral native longhouses along the west seattle shoreline in seattle urban mythology the earlier conflagration is one of the city great turning points the phoenixlike moment from which the city rose up to become the northwests premier metropolis the other is a mere historical footnote forgotten by nearly all of seattle chroniclers even though it made headlines at the time but the two stories they represent seattle urban triumph and the dispossession of local indigenous peopleare in fact one story the path between a boiling pot of glue in and an arsonists torch in represents not just the trajec tory of those four years but a broader pattern in the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth indigenous people in seattle found themselves on the losing side of urban development although many of the specifics of this dispossession by degrees are lost to the historical record the shared context of these two fires offers insights into the seemingly inexorable yet often invis ible marginalization of the duwamish shilshole and lake peoples rudyard kipling imperial apologist and rhetorical bearer of the white mans burden is an unlikely figure to appear in a history of seattle but he offers a graphic if typically acerbic description of the city just after the great fire of arriving in late july as part of a transcontinen tal tour he described the nearapocalyptic aftermath the wharves had all burned down and we tied up where we could crashing into the rot ten foundations of a boathouse as a pig roots in high grass he wrote in the heart of the business quarters there was a horrible black smudge as though a hand had come down and rubbed the place smooth i know now what being wiped out means kipling also noted the scores of can vas tents set up among the ruins full of men carrying on with the lath and string arrangements out of which a western town is made seattle had nearly been unmade by the terrible events of a few weeks earlier when early in the afternoon of june a pot of glue boiled over and started a fire at victor clairmonts basement cabinet shop at the corner of front and madison the flames rapidly spread upward and outward to surrounding wooden buildings thanks to brisk latespring winds and a laughably insufficient water system by nightfall sixty acres thirtythree blocks including virtually the entire business district had burned to the ground and to the waterline yeslers wharf the lava beds and other seattle institutions all disappeared into kiplings black smudge the fire could be seen miles away one snohomish indian woman recalled seeing her older relatives cover their faces with their hands rocking and wailing as the southern horizon glowed redly throughout the night seattleites moved quickly to repair the damage as soon as the ashes cooled business owners resumed their affairs in the canvas tents but they expended little effort on their less seemly neighbors many of whom had lost everything to the flames orange jacobs recalled that the fallen angels and the upper class of gamblers could take care of themselves while other less fortunate citizens required careful and necessary scrutiny to prevent the handing out of free lunches the longstand c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s ing enmity between the people of the lava beds and their more strait laced neighbors shaped responses to the disaster but as before the two elements of seattle society had always existed in a symbiotic relation ship before long the lava beds had resumed activity in fact within months they were more active than ever as the great fire spurred a riot of urban development in the old commercial district wooden struc tures lost to the fire were replaced by ones of brick and stone and as capital poured in to rebuild the city so did new immigrants for the next year more than two thousand new immigrants arrived in seattle every month nearly doubling the city population to over forty thou sand people by the great fires first anniversary in terms of the built landscape population growth and civic selfidentity the great fire was a critical juncture in seattle urban story but in fact the great fire had only accelerated growth already under way it was not the flames of a boiling glue pot but rather those inside a northern pacific railroad engine that had truly sparked seattle great lurch toward metropolis in the city held its railroad jubilee which included a massive salmon barbecue hosted by local indians the jubilee proved premature however the first northern pacific train would not arrive until june over tracks laid by some chinese labor ers and heralded by a twentyonegun salute using cannon from the battle of seattle even then service was poor uncomfortable and inconsistent leading to complaints from locals and the eventual aban donment of the line by the northern pacific it took yet another year for the orphan road to become a functioning railway but when it finally did in late it began a new wave of immigration to seattle that had yet to peak when the city burned eight years later the march edition of the seattle times noted a sharp increase in the number of red denizens on ballast island on the rebuilt seattle waterfront ballast island was exactly what its name implied a massive pile of rock brick and other debris dropped by ships near the foot of washington street it was one of the few places in town where large groups of indians were tolerated on this day in ten large dugout canoes and several smaller ones some loaded down to the water line with furniture tools and trunks of clothing had along with their owners attracted a large and curious crowd of spectators dispatched to ballast island by his editors the reporter soon learned that the canoes occupants had been burned out of their homes on the west seattle shore line according to the indians eight houses had been destroyed their owners and inhabitants turned out indiscriminately without reference to the disposition of the indians who however took the matter with out resistance some of the nowhomeless native people were quite elderly and had lived in west seattle for many years carrying monikers like west seattle jack west seattle jim and west seattle charlie to prove it indeed these were the people of herrings house the old indigenous town which had survived the early phases of urban development but the saturday before a man named watson with the help of several other west seattle residents had started the fire that brought centuries of her rings houses history to an end at first glance the gilded age razing of this small native neighbor hood in west seattle seems an anomaly the deliberate destruction of herrings house seems more in keeping with the spasmodic violence of seattle early years than with the nascent progressivism of the s but the events of march were part of a larger urban process of indigenous dispossession that had begun decades before although that process accelerated in the late nineteenth century with seattle met ropolitan ascent not long before the fire of west seattle had still been an iso lated community separated from seattle by elliott bay and the wide muddy duwamish estuary by the late s its residents were clam oring for regular connections with seattle while seattleites became increasingly interested in excursions to and suburban homes on the west seattle peninsula with its beaches fresh air and views of the water front and olympic mountains and so on christmas eve the ferry city of seattle equipped to carry wagons buggies and cattle began reg ular eightminute passages between the two cities subsidized by the west seattle land improvement company itself bankrolled by san fran cisco capitalists with the new maritime connection the company began buying and clearing land building roads and sidewalks and establishing a cable car line from the ferry landing to a new business district as c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s one observer recalled it was quite the thing for newcomers to ride back and forth just for the pleasure of the fresh salt air even retired deep sea captains enjoyed the trip wharves and grain elevators near the ferry terminal soon followed and by west seattle was in the midst of a development boom in no small part thanks to the population explo sion after the great fire of muckleshoot tribal member gilbert king george described his mothers stories of what that had meant for the people of herrings house my mother told me of the days when this area was being claimed and play mates homes were destroyed for relocation purposes i always remember because she was so puzzled by what happened to her friends home she got up the next day there was a pile of ashes there whole families were removed relocated so you have to wonder you know what are the mental impacts on a mother and a father grandparents who have to literally pick up their family and have to move the great fire of had spurred growth in west seattle which in turn encouraged the fiery ouster of indigenous people living in places slated for improvement the fire of march is unusual only in that it merited the atten tion of the press other fires ignored in newspapers and other histor ical documents continued to smolder in the memories of indigenous people who had witnessed them occasionally these memories found their way into the written record during a landmark s land claims case for example older duwamish indians recalled what had happened to their villages as seattle grew around them in the second half of the nineteenth century major hamilton described how when the settlers came they drove us away and then they destroy the house and even set fires to get us away from these villages similarly jennie davis a lake indian and the daughter of chesheeahud the indigenous home steader on lake unions portage bay portrayed the transition from native to settler residences some of the indian houses was gone and i see where the construction of some of the buildings west seattle itself was the scene of more than one fire sam tecumseh the son of one of arthur dennys close indian allies recalled the large potlatch house that had once stood at herrings house along with the smaller longhouses the result of two summers worth of labor by nearly a score of skilled builders the big house alone was valued in s currency at around when the white settlers came he told the court room through an interpreter then they took possession of the indi ans cleared land and also destroyed the house these indigenous placestories link the fire of march to a longer history in which urban development and indian dispossession went hand in hand seattle growth also caused a major shift in the urban labor pool gone were the days when settlers needed the work of native people to conduct everyday town life when henry yesler needed indian men for his sawmill or white women needed indian women to do their laun dry as more and more newcomers arrived many indigenous people were pushed aside their services no longer necessary for the duwamish man dzakwoos who had kept a homestead on lake union the loss of work forced him to abandon his homestead and relocate to the east where he would become part of a native community living at mono han on lake sammamish where mill jobs remained this community would come to be part of the modernday snoqualmie tribe and present day tribal members understand the changing demographics and econ omy in and around seattle as a key reason for the development of this new community snoqualmie elder ed davis recalled for example that the people at monohan including dzakwoos and his extended family all come together when they run out of jobs and so the refugees from herrings house characterized as indig nant but philosophical by the reporter had some decisions to make as they gathered on ballast island in they could move to the light house colony a windblown squatters encampment at west point north of town and some apparently did or they could move upriver the area around the confluence of the black and duwamish rivers had been the eponymous duwamish inside for centuries and in the s several indian families still lived there in a narrow stretch of the river valley that settlers simply called duwamish the descendants of many of those people would become the modernday duwamish tribe the refugees c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s third option was to go further afield and apply for an allotment of land on one of puget sounds reservations such as port madison later known as suquamish muckleshoot or tulalip for many this last option seemed to be the safest at a time when indian people enjoyed few legal rights faced discrimination and hostility from many of their nonnative neighbors and were often forced to live at the peripheries of the new economy land even when held in trust could offer security that life in and immediately around seattle could not ironically the rapid urban expansion that had fueled the fire in west seattle with its ferries and beach cabins slowed soon after the com munity of herrings house was razed and its members dispersed just a few weeks after watsons arson the stock market collapsed and banks began to fail across the nation the panic of was on in west seat tle the panic led to what one observer called a nervous breakdown the ferries and cable car stopped running realestate ventures crum bled and growth came to a standstill the depression that followed damp ened seattle spirits for four long years and we might ask whether west seattle charlie and his neighbors might have still had homes on the shore there if only the timing had been a little different meanwhile other native people continued to live in seattle albeit in diminishing numbers after the burning of herrings house in fact it was those diminishing numbers that would lead to a change in the way indigenous people were portrayed in seattleindeed the fact that they were portrayed at all whereas the workings of indigenous dispos session in the late nineteenth century rarely appear in the historical record by the dawn of the twentieth century indians in seattleespecially ones that seemed to be vanishingwere frontpage news o n the last evening of may kikisebloo the daughter of seeathl died of tuberculosis in her home on the seattle waterfront her passing was big news in the city where shops sold postcards of her image and where a chance encounter with the indian princess was one of the highlights of the urban experience children sneaked into the city morgue to see her body while undertakers argued over who had the right to bury it when the funeral finally took place on june thousands of seattleites lined downtown streets to watch the procession make its way to a full requiem mass at our lady of good hope afterward kikisebloo was laid to rest in lakeview cemetery in a canoeshaped coffin next to her old friend and ally henry yesler her grandson joe foster whose terrorized mother had committed suicide so many years before during seattle village period was the sole indian present kikisebloos life had been like seattle indian history writ small present with her father at the denny partys settlement at alki she was closely allied with seattle founding families many of whom employed her as a washerwoman simultaneously noblewoman and drudge kiki sebloo elicited a wide range of reactions from her white neighbors some revered her as a touchstone to the indigenous past case in point her muchballyhooed introduction to visiting us president benjamin harrison in while others especially young people were more likely to throw rocks at her as she passed in the street for her part kikisebloo was famous both for her loyalty to pioneer families and for throwing stones of her own or clams or potatoes depending on what was handy at her tormentors in the last years of her life she lived in poverty on the seattle waterfront simultaneously watched over by solic itous society women and lampooned in the press by the time of her death kikisebloo had come to represent both the noble savage expressed best by the urban legend that she had brought warning of the indian uprising to seattle residents and the stubborn back ward siwash doomed to extinction in the nineteenth century kikisebloos life had reflected many of the contradictions inherent in seattle indian story on the eve of the twen tieth century however her death heralded a new pattern the presence of indigenous people in seattle was used by white observers to craft a powerful new narrative about the inevitable disappearance of indians from seattle and the modern world native people had always been sym bols in seattlewitness the debates about vice fire and disease in the village periodbut in earlier decades they had also been a force to be c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s reckoned with as their numbers dwindled in the early twentieth cen tury local indians were recast as stock characters in melodramatic sto ries about urban progress representing both the inevitability of indigenous decline and the inexorable ascent of metropolitan seattle here was a new placestory while she was by far the most celebrated of seattle last indians kikisebloo was by no means the last of the last other duwamish lake and shilshole people continued to live in seattle well into the twenti eth century some displayed a remarkable commitment to particular places on salmon bay for example the small cedarplank home of hwelchteed and his wife cheethluleetsa also known as madeline was a distinctive landmark on the shore opposite a settlement now known as ballard cheethluleetsa and her husband harvested clams salmon and berries to sell in ballard using the income to purchase items from area merchants or for ceremonies held with visiting relatives like another salmon bay indian nicknamed crab john whose shouts of salmon ten cents were a fond memory of many ballard residents hwelchteed and cheethluleetsa were living links between the indige nous town of tucked away inside and the modern town of ballard indeed hwelchteed portrayed himself as the hereditary headman of the shilsholes and as such garnered much attention from residents and tourists alike particularly after the death of kikisebloo meanwhile on portage bay at the eastern end of lake union che sheeahud and his wife tleebuleetsa confusingly also called madeline regularly entertained visitors from area reservations at their homestead when tleebuleetsa lay dying in the spring of relatives came from area reservations and elsewhere to keep vigil and a seattle postintelli gencer photographer captured the image of family members as they arrived at the small house on the flats of portage bay in the background of the photo the new university of washington campus and streetcar suburbs reach to the horizon two supposedly separate worldsthe urban and the indigenouswere in fact the same place nowhere is this clearer than at chesheeahud and tleebuleetsas graves which lie in the old section of seattle evergreenwashelli cemetery immediately next to that of hiram gill a controversial seattle mayor who made his career playing off the bad blood between lava beds society and the law and order crowd hwelchteed chesheeahud and their wives were relatively success ful at surviving in seattle but other indigenous people had a harder time of it living among the marshy suburbs on portage bay was one thing trying to eke out a living on the industrial downtown waterfront was another in a duwamish couple named billy and ellen phillips made the headlines after a winter storm destroyed billys crabbing boat their primary source of income identified as a nephew of see athl billy whose whulshootseed name was sbeebayoo and his wife quickly became a minor cause c√©l√®bre the postintelligencer printed graphic descriptions of the couples living conditions in their cabin at the foot of stacy street both were malnourished billy was nearly blind and ellen was suffering from chest pains for some time they had been surviving on neighbors stale bread and on fish donated by a nearby cannery the postintelligencer coverage inspired a broader charity cam paign aimed at not just keeping them alive but also paying for their relo cation as reporters milked the story for all it was worth they also chronicled the process by which a skilled fisherman and his wife had been reduced to such dire circumstances his camping places along the puget sound shoreline had become private property and the new owners resented indian trespassers both game and fish were harder to come by as habitat loss pollution and commercial fishing took their toll even billys canoe had been lost these factors combined with age and ill health had nearly spelled the end for ellen and billy the struggle of the phillips was not unique to seattle throughout puget sound indigenous people were finding fewer and fewer places to call their own while the treaties of had allowed indians to leave the reservation to hunt and fish and work living offreservation was another matter especially as the nonindian population continued to burgeon bureau of indian affairs agent s a eliot described the sit uation in the s the most serious situation among the sound indians is occasioned by the large number of homeless vagrants the reservations on the sound are c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s now all allotted and there remains a remnant variously estimated at from one to three thousand indians who are landless and homeless these people wander up and down the sound living on the beaches and constantly evicted or ordered to move on by their white neighbors in one or two places they have established considerable villages but they have nothing there but squat ters rights in the s suquamish tribal member charles alexis reported seeing other indians living in impoverished conditions on sandspits and in other marginal locations around puget sound in earlier years the lighthouse colony at west point to which some of the refugees of the herrings house arson had briefly removed was one such place while alexis and eliot had very different perspectives on these landless native people one as a tribal witness in a land claims case the other as a government advocate of indian industrial and moral developmentthey both saw indian landlessness in urban puget sound as a dilemma for many native families still living in and around seattle in the s allotment at muckleshoot suquamish and other reservations remained the most realistic solution to this dilemma in their applications for allot ment indian men and women both outlined their long connections to tucked away inside and other indigenous communities as well as to seattle itself and exchanged those connections for a new kind of secu rity on the reservations even lake union john the man named for his place left the city soon after his wifes death in chesheeahud sold his property on portage bay making him one of the richest indi ans in puget sound and removed to the port madison reservation where he died four years later the only reminder of his presence on the bay was the name of the plat set up on his former homestead even today legal descriptions of lots in the neighborhood designate them as part of johns addition billy and ellen phillips did not initially relocate to a reservation instead with the help of cousins from suquamish and donations from nonindian seattleites the couple moved into a new cabin on salmon bay next to that of hwelchteed and cheethluleetsa who may have been relatives the little enclave near old tucked away inside would not exist much longer though sometime in or during construction of locks for a ship canal connecting puget sound to lake washington cheethluleetsa died three months later indian agents from port madison came to take hwelchteed to the reservation soon after that billy phillips burned their home in keeping with native strictures against moving into a house where someone had died neighbor andrew jacob sen recalled that the phillips place caught fire as well he let that burn too he was clearing the land when the locks were completed in none of the old indigenous people remained near the site of old tucked away inside the only indian people living on salmon bay were the mixedrace inhabitants of ballard and surrounding neighborhoods although they offer glimpses into the concrete workings of indige nous marginalization contemporary accounts of seattle last indi ans also reflect deepseated assumptions about the racial destiny of native people in general not unlike tales of indian ghosts these are placestories inhabited by the vanishing indian and a cast of charac ters drawn from the broader national imagination princess angeline was the pocahontas of the west the phillips were members of the fast falling band of siwashes and lake union john and madeline represented a final chapter in the romantic history of early seattle as elsewhere in the country indigenous people who survived in seat tle seemed like temporal anomalies holdouts from an earlier age of native women selling wares on the city streets for example one writer claimed that nothing has ever happened to any of them in the city but they remain what darwin calls a persistent type and stuck like a porous plaster white writers described other native seattleites in similar ways mandy seattle lived in the past when she herself was young and straight as the shoots of the alder in springtime while her kinswoman mary sam seattle who had once helped clear land for the first settlers had been left by the side jetsam thrown up by the ebb and flow of human activities as exemplified in the upbuilding of this city simul taneously stuck in the past and vanishing into it indigenous people in seattle were characterized by local newspapers as our citizens of yes terday and a wretched remnant accounts of people like salmon bay charlie then were often clouded c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s by powerful ideas about the inevitable decline and disappearance of indi ans as a race they also reflected a major shift in the place of indian people in urban affairs as combatants and laborers alleged vectors of contagion and supposed purveyors of vice indians had played a cen tral and material role in civic politics in the nineteenth century by the early twentieth century however indians were no longer a threat no one was worried about hwelchteed and his wife bringing smallpox to town or about tleebuleetsa and her husband burning down the city and aside from the few who ponied up cash for the phillips move nei ther did white seattleites seem all that concerned about their longterm welfare instead the presence of people like mandy seattle simply served as an allegory about both the fate of the vanishing race and the city urban success seen as having little material use indigenous people could still serve a rhetorical purpose they could still be used to tell placestories like indigenous people indigenous places also served important sym bolic roles in twentiethcentury seattle there was a growing interest in seattle and around the country in indian placenames both uni versity of washington anthropologist t t waterman and his history department colleague edmond s meany for example received regular requests for picturesque and quaint indian names for estates beach cabins boats and parks elsewhere such names could be used to mar ket urban development itself in the spring of for example the realestate firm of calhoun denny and ewing held a promotional event for their new residential plat just in time for the alaskayukonpacific exposition called licton springs the neighborhoodtobe just beyond seattle northern city limit drew its name from the red pigment that native people had collected there for use in ceremonies in fact it was this connection to the indigenous past that made licton springs desir able the opening of a plat with these natural features in the east would create a riot crowed one advertisement they have learned to appre ciate such treasures apparently seattle is arriving at such a stage using legends of our indian tribes now extinct to sell suburban homesites made perfect sense in seattle where actual indigenous people seemed to be on their way out save for here or there a relic as great throngs rode new trolleys to licton springs they took the waters visited the nearby shake cabin that had once belonged to david denny and entered contests to win free lots however should one of those indian relics deign to worship the god of health at the springsor more tellingly should one of their ghosts choose to haunt the placeone writer warned what would happen and it may come to pass that if the spirit of chief seattle or leschi or what soever hyas tyee was wont to come to mix his war paint at licton springs in the centuries that are passed should chance again this way on a similar mission bent he would come plum against a bluecoated brassbuttoned caretaker who would take him by the lapel of his war bonnet and leading him down the cement walk among the electric lights to the confines of licton park should tell him to move on for this is the th century and to move on is the edict for all of us taken alongside the experiences of sbeebayoo and other native men and women this licton springs placestory suggested that there was very little room for indigenous peoplealive or undeadin modern seattle their legends and placenames on the other hand made great copy even the symbolic landscape now seemed to belong to the new changers s eattle is a bad place to build a city steep hills of crum bly sand atop slippery clay a winding river with a wide estu ary and expansive tidal flats ice age kettle lakes and bogs and plunging ravines and creeks are all sandwiched between puget sound and vast deep lake washington but it was built anyway despite all this and today seattle watersheds in particular are among its most transformed landscapes where four rivers once joined to become the duwamish now only one flows lake washington empties to the west instead of the south and is shallower other lakes creeks and beaches have been filled dredged culverted and bulkheaded in the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the twentieth roughly the same years that the last indians populated seattle head c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s linesthe city undertook a series of massive engineering projects that turned hills into islands straightened one river and obliterated another and reshaped entire watersheds driven by what one urban scholar has called the leveling impulse seattle civic leaders had long held ambitious visions for improving what they called the natural advantages of their city the deepwater port backed by two significant bodies of freshwater had spelled oppor tunity since the fourth of july when thomas mercer gave the name lake union to a body of water he hoped would someday link lake washington with puget sound despite various attempts at linking the lakes with flumes and ditches largescale efforts were beyond the reach of the young city other problemsmost notably the steep hills that ringed downtown and the untidy margin between land and sea remained unsolved throughout much of seattle early history by the end of the nineteenth century however the technology and capital were available to begin serious attempts at terraforming in former gov ernor eugene semple proposed cutting a canal through beacon hill to connect lake washington with the duwamish river which until that point had only connected via the shallow sluggish and snagfilled black river authorized by the state legislature construction began in with soil and clay from beacon hill being used to fill the tide lands at the mouth of the duwamish while the south canal project never reached completioncaveins and spiraling costs proved its death knellsemples passion for reshaping the seattle landscape continued in the works of other men the managers of the seattle general con struction company for example carried on with the filling of the tide lands using sediments dredged from the duwamish eight years and million cubic yards of silt later the company had replaced the river delta with the worlds largest manmade island flat dry and ready for industrial tenants that same year the floodprone meandering duwamish long a source of frustration became the focus of engineers efforts with the creation of the duwamish waterway commission dredging began in the fall of and by only one original bend of the river remained within the city limits the rest was a moreorless straight fiftyfootdeep channel ideal for large seagoing vessels the most dramatic project however took semples idea of a canal and moved it north under the leadership of hiram m chittenden of the army corps of engineers and seattle city engineer reginald h thomson the lake washington ship canal linked puget sound lake union and lake washington through stateoftheart locks at salmon bay opening the lakes to maritime traffic beginning in denny hill was mostly gone by then too its earth used to fill tidelands that now fronted a wide straight and deep duwamish waterway the lake wash ington watershed had been reoriented entirely instead of flowing south out of the black river it now moved north and west through the hiram m chittenden locks in ballard and the lake itself was ten to twenty feet lower together all of these changes would have profound impacts on indigenous people and places for the men who envisioned and then enacted these changes indi ans were irrelevant except as emblems of a vanishing past native people virtually never appear in the writings and plans of thomson chitten den and the other modern changers instead the creators of seattle new urban ecology thought they were improving nature thomson for example called the duwamishs natural curves ugly and unsightly preferring a channelized and useful river to one that was messy and unpredictable meanwhile ship canal visionary chittenden argued that the transformation of lake washington and lake union was distinctly a case where utilitarian ends can be accomplished without any sacrifice of sentimental interests each of these men downplayed the social costs of reengineering seattle landscape relocating undesirable people when mentioned at all was simply one of the benefits of efficient urban planning that none of them mentioned indians should not come as a sur prise for one thing adherents to the modern urbanplanning tradi tion paid little attention to local knowledge or history instead they looked to abstract positivist models in which attachments to place and past bore little relevance in other words indigeneity and modernity were mutually exclusive in the minds of urban planners at the same time urban indians were disappearing into a diverse category of people and communities known as seattle underclass a grouping that would serve c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s as the bogeyman in planning schemes for decades to come the pres ence of indian people when noticed at all could in fact mark areas in need of urban renewal in for example one observer described the shantytown neighborhood around kikisebloos house on the waterfront in language similar to that used to malign the duwamish and the places where a canal needed to be built what a blemish on this fair and growing city is that particular locality where scores of shanties leantos and sheds holding a heterogeneous mass of humanity are huddled togetherlittle children with old faces unkempt men and women dirty dogs stray cats the sewage from unclean sewers pouring down contagion and filth moral and physical illbeingall down that hill side where the tumbledown dwellings are piled in many cases one over the other in a pattern that had begun with the old lava beds and that would con tinue into the late twentieth century indianness became a marker of urban disorder in the case of thomson chittenden and their fellow changers though those in charge of landscape change were more likely to ignore indigenous people altogether not that there wasnt evidence of native people all around thomson and the others beyond the frontpage stories of billy phillips and other beleaguered last indians largescale civicengineering projects could themselves reveal evidence of the indigenous inhabitants of seattle this was particularly true in the case of the lake washington ship canal in workers exposed a deep shell midden that had once been part of tucked away inside and when lake washington dropped several feet in as the last barrier between it and lake union was dyna mited even older relics were revealed at a marshy cove on union bay rows of wooden poststhe remains of the fishing weir at the indige nous town of little canoe channelstood exposed and ancient stone hearths resurfaced along the new lower shoreline but even these dis coveries could serve as arguments for the improvements to lake wash ington in the seattle town crier m j carter wrote that the hearths created by a dusky race of primitive men proved that the canal was a natural improvement nature moves slowly and on many feet he wrote but man harnessing the pent forces of the earth to his needs strikes with irreverent hand and the entombed secrets of the past stand revealed rather than evoke the importance of such places to indige nous people these unearthings only confirmed the naturalness of the engineering marvels that revealed and then obliterated them these men thought they were restoring nature but for native people trying to maintain connections to traditional places within seattle the changes to the landscape in the first two decades of the twentieth century were far from irrelevantthey were devastat ing simply finding traditional foods for example had become close to impossible the duwamish estuarys eelgrass beds which had shel tered young salmon and armies of herring were gone buried under the fill of harbor island and bisected by the new duwamish waterway the great middens around smiths coveproof of the spots wealth of clams and other shellfishwere now covered by a landfill the oxbows and bends of the duwamish once home to clouds of waterfowl had become avenues for global shipping and when lake washington dropped with the opening of the ship canal its outlet the black river ceased to exist duwamish descendant joseph moses recalled that it was quite a day for the white people at least the waters just went down down he told a local historian until our landing and canoes stood dry and there was no black river at all there were pools of course and the struggling fish trapped in them people came from miles around laughing and hollering and stuffing fish into gunny sacks and on lake union business and residential development wiped out the trout pop ulation too much house nowall gone chesheeahud told one observer not long before he finally just sold up and left for the reser vation in reordering the landscape for urban utility seattle chang ers had dramatically reduced the utilityand habitabilityof that landscape for indigenous people there was an element of truth then in the lastness of indians in seattle in the s anthropologist thomas talbot waterman noted that seetoowathl ollie wilburs relative with the crazy wife was one of the only indigenous people left in seattle in many ways men and c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s women like seetoowathl and mandy seattle were the last indigenous generation certainly there were people of indigenous ancestry who continued to live in the city across salmon bay from hwelchteed and cheethluleetsa for example several families of shilshole heritage lived in ballard and people with roots in communities such as her rings house and place of the fish spear could be found in other parts of the city in them the socalled vanishing race carried on but in terms of indigeneitywhich we might define by subsistence patterns use of traditional places ceremonial practices firsthand experience with the preurban landscape and not insignificantly the perceptions of observersthe deaths and departures of tleebuleetsa chesheeahud and the others did in fact mark a discontinuity in seattle native his tory the first decades of the twentieth century did not spell the end of indian seattle by any means but they were the end of indigenous seattle during those same decades indigenous knowledge of seattle often came to be located outside the city on reservations like muckleshoot and suquamish or in small enclaves like the duwamish community at black river when academics and amateur ethnographers went in search of native knowledge of the places that had become seattle they rarely went to the city their lists of collaborators in fact read like shorthand for the slow erosion of indigenous presence in seattle watermans informants anne seattle and lucy eells living at muckleshoot both had fathers who were born at little crossingover place the settlement now buried under downtowns king street railway station julie jacob born african american and abandoned as an infant on ballast island before being adopted by jacob wahalchoo and his wife shared her cul tural knowledge in her home on the reservation at suquamish so did jennie john davis the daughter of chesheeahud local knowledge was no longer local understanding of indigenous seattle could best be obtained by getting out of the city meanwhile for people whose indigenous ancestors had left seattle decades earlier places in seattle remained important clam beds fishing sites campgrounds but just as urban landscape change brought billy phillips and his wife to the brink of starvation it would also erode connections between outlying native communities and indigenous places within the urban fabric in a interview for example muck leshoot community member but enrolled puyallup art williams born in described traveling to alki point during the summers of his childhood there his parents would build a small timber and buckskin shelter and for two or three weeks they and other families would har vest clams mussels geoduck octopus and salmon from elliott bay and the duwamish estuary all along youd see bonfires he told the inter viewer all along the beaches where they cooked clams and do every thing accompanied by drumming songs and stories the annual trip to alki was a continuation of older seasonal rounds fishing and clam ming were only part of the action the main event took place across elliott bay at the foot of james street on the seattle waterfront there native people would trade whatever you got in williamss words woolen blankets and dried clams camas bulbs and buckskins for two or three weeks they would have a big potlatch everybody come there and say goodbye to one another til next year comes and then have it over again that was about to end as art williams got older the trips to alki point and the seattle waterfront became more difficult as white seat tleites began to build beach houses with names like dewdrop inn and bideawee facing the beach at alki indian encampments were less wel come no no no camping no more williams recalled they said no no more camps they wouldnt let us incorporated into seattle in west seattle had changed from an outlying community to an urban neighborhood leaving less and less room for native encampments urban growth and its attendant environmental impacts meanwhile led to new conservation law indigenous people would bear the brunt of these changes as well state records pertaining to the arrest of native people for fishing in the duwamish and on elliott bay no longer exist but jennie davis testified some years later that the duwamish and other local indians had to stop fishing or they will be arrested indian agent charles m buchanan was particularly strident in his opinions about the criminalization of indigenous fisheries on puget sound especially in urban places the indians of this agency have donated to the white man all of the great townsites of puget sound he argued in no c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s indian has given moreno indian has received less he placed the blame on the stringent and harsh application to indians of the state game and fish laws done under color of law enforcement of these unjust laws moreover led to real criminality reducing indians to beg gary and theft by when art williams returned from the chemawa boarding school in oregon he and his family had to sneak around different places to harvest fish and clams they found how ever that shellfish harvests at alki point had dwindled and williams attributed this not just to urban development and scapegoating laws but to the fact that indian people were no longer allowed to go there simply to pray for the clams continued abundance indigenous stew ardship of the environment with all its religious components had been sundered and much more than clams had disappeared urban growth had also destroyed the numinous forces that had given many local places their meaning the story of ballards early political history for example is the story of residents struggling to keep each others cattle from foul ing the creek that was the towns main water supply to the shilsholes that creek had once been known as spirit canoe after the power that resided there but by the early twentieth century the power was said to have fled likely offended by the feces and urine of the bostons beasts by the early twentieth century there were fewer outoftheway places for spirit powers and the practices that accessed them to carry on unmo lested meanwhile a duwamish elder described to ethnographer john peabody harrington the effects of urban development on a supernat ural horned serpent known to inhabit the lake washington shoreline and once employed by some of the most powerful and feared shamans harringtons notes simply say that by the s it was gone not there now around that same time a boulder inscribed with shamanic power figures on the west seattle shoreline was buried under fill and concrete foundations in the late twentieth century some indian people would return to sacred sites in seattle but during the years of the city most rapid growth at least some local indigenous people felt that urban change had destroyed dispersed or submerged many of the landscapes spir itual and thus most fundamental qualities in fact the primary placestory local indigenous people told about seattle in the early twentieth century was one of alienation and erasure other informants recounted for harrington what had happened else where in the city contrasting indigenous places with their current con ditions of the firs at littlebitstraight point where a settlement and stockade had once guarded the mouth of the duwamish river settlers had cut them long ago and in their place stood the rainier brewery the nearby town of place of the fish spear meanwhile now lay beneath the seattle electric company machine shops and new calami ties always seemed possible when construction of the alki playground in west seattle uncovered the remains of several smallpox victims in some local indians were concerned that a new epidemic would be visited upon the area together these stories made up an indigenous accounting of urban transformation in which a new kind of changer men like r h thomson and watson the arsonist had reworked the creations of the original changer for people like hwelchteed who resis ted leaving salmon bay until the very end of his life and for art williams who had never called seattle home but who came there every year con nections to seattle indigenous landscape had been almost severed this is not to say that people from reservations and tribal commu nities stopped coming to the city as it did for most people living in outlying areas indian or otherwise the city offered services and ameni ties and jobs that were unavailable elsewhere parents brought children from suquamish to visit doctors in seattle muckleshoot men and women came to the city to shop a skagit shaman could get cataract surgery in the city tulalip allottees could go to the courthouse to demand land payments and in a city still fueled by sawmills canneries and shipyards there was always the possibility of paid work the new urban landscapethe glitter of the department stores the seediness of skid road the bustle of the waterfrontmight have destroyed the indige nous landscape of horned serpents and herring runs but it still attracted indian people who engaged the city on indian if not always indigenous terms for all their differences seattle indigenous and urban landscapes were often closer together than they seemed while one had appeared c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s to give way to the other in a dramatically short period of time in real ity both existed simultaneously in the minds of many native people muckleshoot elder florence dosie starr wynn for example told an interviewer about trips made to the city in the s and about the persistence of seattle indigenous landscape in her grandmothers memory we went to the waterfront and we went up to the public market and we used to go up there and when wed take her shopping wed go through that road through duwamish that way and she named all the rocks the hillswell theyre gone now because of blasting and new homes going in and busi nesses but they had names for every one of them rocks down there stories about those hills all along that valley there the placestories dosies grandmother told her were those of north wind and south wind of the dwarves that helped spirit canoe travelers and of lookouts posted on hills to warn of slavers from the north the land scape might have been changed almost beyond recognitionthe sacred horned snake gone not there nowbut the memory of these things remained vital for the descendants of seattle indigenous people in suquamish elder mary thompson said it best telling a seattle times reporter that although she seldom visited the city named after her great grandfather she remained connected to the place i always feel that i own it somehow she said meanwhile a small community of duwam ish people continued to live within the city blending in as far as out siders could tell but maintaining their own sense of themselves as a people decades later their story would resurface and the transition between indigenous and urban ecologies represented by changes like the lake washington ship canal would be central to that story and then there is the indigenous name for the city itself when ethno graphers like harrington and waterman in the s and marian wes ley smith in the s interviewed elders throughout puget sound they found that most did not refer to the city by the name chosen by arthur denny and his pioneer compatriots instead they used the name of the indigenous settlement buried long ago under the sawdust from yeslers mill on the eve of the second world war almost a century after the founding of seattle little crossingover place continued to exist in the hearts and minds of indian people t he float house at tideflats where seetoowathl lived with his unpleasant wife at the turn of the century did not escape the changers the couple had struggled in the first years of the twentieth century as the dogfish oil industry collapsed with the introduction of petroleum products some of their indian neigh bors moved on to the reservations while others passed away meanwhile the duwamish river on which their home rose and fell with the tides had changed dramatically after all the dredging and filling and straight ening they now lived on the last remaining natural bend of the lower river relatives came less frequently ollie wilbur and her parents had stopped coming because they didnt care to go there anymore it might have been that isolation together with infirmity and the industrial land scape that surrounded them that spelled the end in the s thomas talbot waterman described seetoowathl as haleappearing but that would change very quickly in the winter of seetoowathl and his wife starved to death he died you know recalled his greatgrand niece ollie and they just cremated his body you know the crazy woman and the old man who refused to speak english had chosen to stay on the river and that choice had cost them their lives the fact that two old people indian or otherwise could starve to death in seattle in is an indictment of the failings of the pro gressive era the city now had over residents and had achieved remarkable successes most notably the tallest building west of the mississippithe smith tower completed in stood within sight of the duwamish a testament to wealth competence and confidence from its upper floors one might have been able to see the curve of the river at tideflats but the progressive ethos of reform charity and order for all its successes could not make the cognitive leap from skyscraper to float house then again the progressive era which saw great leaps forward in medicine social work conservation and suffrage was also the era of jim crow the alien land law the c i t y o f t h e c h a n g e r s first red scare and the disaster of indian allotment why should seat tle have been any different during construction of the lake washington ship canal engineer hiram chittenden had once written that critics of the canal disliked such projects simply because they destroy old associations those who have been familiar all their lives with certain conditions are natu rally loth sic to see them changed for many indian people the old associations had been destroyed almost completely in the decades between the coming of the railroad and the great depression indian agency in seattle is hard to find it is there though in the applications for allotment in the death vigil held near the university grounds in the sneak fishing on the duwamish these small acts would provide tenuous links between the indigenous past and future reclaimings of urban space by indian people meanwhile during the same decades that indigenous seattle was reaching its nadir another kind of indian history was on the rise in describing her kinsmans house on the river ollie wilbur recalled that a number of the indians living at tideflats were not kin of hers or of anyone she knew they were what those who still spoke whulshootseed called by a name that meant something like from the surf s mouth they were from far far away and they had come to make seattle theirs on the cusp of past and future m arian wesley smith an anthropologist at columbia university spent much of the s conducting research among the native peoples of puget sound her travels brought her into contact with the descendants of the indi genous people of seattle and the urbanized landscape of the presecond world war maritime northwest shaped much of what she had to say about the state of indians in the region native people on puget sound smith argued had come through remarkably well considering the rig orous mushroom development of places like seattle no other indi ans of the whole continent have been similarly engulfed by the sudden growth of city populations or have been exposed to the full impact of twentiethcentury urban society she wrote in the s to smith the successful adaptation of puget sounds native peoples was certainly better than that of many indians classified as less primitive in fact she wrote it is this sort of dilemma that throws doubt upon classification schemes despite the neartotal dispossession of indigenous people from seattle urban landscape surviving native peoples accommo dation to urban change in puget sound seemed to challenge her dis ciplines very foundations the conditions of indian people in urban puget sound also threw doubt upon another kind of classification scheme the boundaries between past present and future smith saw this just as clearly if today salish life is mingled with and sometimes indistinguishable from modern american and canadian life she wrote so much the better if the past and the present converge and the future may be expected to partake of both so much closer to reality is our picture of the north west and for indians in seattle in the s the past present and future did seem to converge like the years surrounding the s were a transition between two periods in the city urban and indian histories a hinge between one era and another the years around had represented a transition between a strong indigenous presence in seattle and indigenous dispossession as well as the beginnings of a regional indian hinterland by the s seattle had developed a com plex interweaving of multiple native histories duwamish descen dants of the areas indigenous communities and native people from far away shared a city studded with totem poles and explained by sto ries about indians mr glovers birdseye panorama the census and other sources had offered glimpses of native seattle on the eve of a massive urban transformation sources from the s show the results of that transformation and offer their own glimpses into a city that unbeknownst to its residents indian or otherwise was on the eve of yet another great change in seattle was a bona fide metropolis a city of people few vestiges of the indigenous landscape remainedthe duwamish river had been straightened the waters of lake washing ton now flowed through the hiram m chittenden locks rather than the extinct black river and new neighborhoods of bungalows and apart ments blanketed hills that had once been barriers to urban growth it seemed that seattle had made good on its urban promises but instead of optimism there was anxiety seattle was experiencing the first throes of the great depression and as it had during the panic of seat tles boomandbust economy was suffering greatly the crash of also changed the lives of indian people in seattle many of the small firms that had fueled annual migrations of native men and women to seattlefarms sawmills cannerieslaid off their indian workers first then closed as banks failed layoffs and business failures slowed the widespread movements of native people up and down the coast and from reservations in puget sound where many of the descendants of seattle indigenous people now lived the depression also wreaked havoc on indian attempts to establish a permanent presence in seat tle for example ralph young or looshk√°t a hoonah raven tlingit and founding member of the alaska native brotherhood found his for tunes changing in the s after helping discover the wildly successful chichagof mine in alaska young and his uncle had traded their shares in the mine for property along the industrializing duwamish soon after the market collapse however the men were forced to for feit the profitable land which would eventually be occupied by the boe ing company because of unpaid taxes and return to alaska despite the dislocations of the depression however indian people had found ways to call seattle home the manuscript of the cen sus offers insight into the lives of the city native men women and children their numbers were not greatless than percent of the urban populationbut their circumstances speak to the roots that indian people from other places were putting down in seattle urban soil those roots like the city itself were often thoroughly working class across the city indian men and women could be found in seattle bungalow neighborhoods of modest income on beacon hill choctaw pipe fitter franklin turner came home from long days at the oil plant to a neigh borhood of mechanics and construction workers where his white wife ellen kept house on capitol hill mixedblood canadianborn lily lee lived with her white husband lorn who helped build and maintain the city bridges like that of the turners the lees neighborhood was mostly white and thoroughly working class with neighbors working as bakers and seamstresses cashiers and electricians so was the admi ral neighborhood on duwamish head where truck driver robert lee no relation to lorn and his fullblood washington indian wife min nie provided for their eightyearold son eugene and admiral was much like south park along the duwamish where the whiteinuit ryner family lived off the money husband homer earned as a stone polisher in a local factory there was also a cluster of mixedrace families around salmon bay swedish immigrant paul peterson a deckhand on a tug lived with his skagit wife clara and their teenage sons bernard and chester on the flats near the western stretch of the ship canal nellie wooley an alaskan haida kept house for her boatbuilder husband john in the industrial area that had sprung up on the nowfilled estuary between salmon bay and smiths cove on the south side of salmon bay not far from the site of hwelchteeds old place the scottish and o n t h e c u s p o f p a s t a n d f u t u r e stoney indian darling family got by on john darlings earnings as a construction worker although the experiences of most of these families are lost to his tory two mixedrace families living near salmon bay left some records behind giving us a sense of their lives beyond the census enumera tors rows and columns and offering insights into what it meant to be indian in seattle one family the youngbloods lived in the crown hill area north of salmon bay bowhertta ladder the matriarch of the fam ily had been born among the nuuchahnulth but raised by the makah and now made baskets and sold them downtown for up to ten dollars each her daughter minnie worked as a domestic servant and sonin law john youngblood ran a gas station for all their seeming success the family faced challenges barry hawley whose father married into the family recalled that indians were discriminated against in many bad ways it was very hard for those young people meanwhile karl peterson a swedishborn longshoreman mourned the recent death of his makah wife ann and struggled to raise their daughter helen helen peterson schmitt described a city where no indians allowed signs hung in shop windows leading her to hide her makah ancestry for schmitt the lutefisk gl√∂gg and hambos of her fathers people were the ethnic traditions with which she identified and only decades later would she reconnect with her makah relatives on the other hand one of the few things schmitt knew for sure about her mother was her visibility as an indian when the police had a little lost indian per son who didnt speak english she told an interviewer decades later they brought her to my mother so shed help with them despite the pressures to hide ones native ancestry then the story of ann peter son suggests that indians were recognized and recognized each other in the city in the s indianness could also shape white identities in seat tle poet and novelist richard hugo for example once described the death of an indian firstgrade classmate who drowned after becoming trapped under a log boom on the duwamish his mother flipped and for years called him to dinner every evening in prolonged fits of scream hugo recalled but despite their role as friends and neigh bors native people in hugos neighborhood were also markers of the lower class to kids like hugo who grew up in poor duwamish river neigh borhoods like youngstown and riverside middleclass west seattle towered over the sources of felt debasement the filthy loud belching steel mill the oily slow river the immigrants hanging on to their odd ways indians getting drunk in the unswept taverns the commercial fisher men tugboat workers and mill workers with their coarse manners for hugo indian people were simultaneously neighbors and metaphors members of the urban lower classes as well as symbols of urban poverty he was not alone in a masters thesis examining the social dynam ics of hooverville the homeless encampment on the old duwamish tideflats sociologist donald roy described the residents as natives noted that their homes resembled those of the siberian chuckchee and described prostitutes who sometimes visited hooverille as squaws although only out of hoovervilles residents were native accord ing to roys count he nonetheless used native imagery to highlight the poverty of seattle homeless we might wonder whether the natives on the tideflats were called that thanks to memories of native migrants camped in those same places only a few years earlier there was some truth to the connections made by hugo and roy between poverty and indian identity beyond the workingclass neigh borhoods where some mixedrace families lived native people in s seattle were most likely to be found in places inhabited by the city poorest people one such place was the district of singleresident occupancy sro hotels that made up much of downtowns landscape including pioneer square and chinatown two dense neighborhoods that had grown up on the site of the old lava beds there indian men and women found shelter among the flophouses and apartment build ings frank griffey an indian railroad worker from indiana lived at the interurban hotel on occidental avenue while tlingit radio musi cian jimmie thomas rented a room in the grant hotel on seventh avenue south other native people found slightly more reputable accom modations in apartment hotels further uptown estelle hovland a m√©tis waitress from north dakota lived in the newly decorated and refur bished hotel rehan on seventh and union while greek immigrant o n t h e c u s p o f p a s t a n d f u t u r e track layer george ramos and his blackfoot wife hazel lived with their newborn son in the yale apartments at sixth and columbia hotels and apartments like the yale and the interurban often had their own repu tations among native people makah people told one anthropologist for example that some sro hotels were quite notorious among their people those who make short trips to the cities stay in hotels patronized by whites though the hotels most generally frequented would be regarded as third or fourth rate one hotel popular with the makah is over a noisy dance hall where incoming sailors gather one of the hotel chambermaids swore that she would not stay in the place overnight that it was bad enough to have to work there during the day however both white men and white women stay in the hotel which was once one of the good hotels in the city others from neah bay patronize hotels in quieter locations which are said to have better reputations just as the presence of indians could be a marker of poor neighbor hoods in the eyes of white observers whiteness as well as class dis tinctions played a factor in makah peoples understandings of the city life in seattle in the s brought native people into contact with more than just the city white residents both the interurban and grant hotelsas well as the hotel marion where joseph carrasco a chilean alaskan indian steelworker lived and the kenney apartments on james street where widowed tlingit domestic worker mary bezonoff roomed were run by japanese immigrants and their americanborn children meanwhile life in the sro districts also meant that many indian people had everyday encounters with filipino sailors agricultural workers and laborers who made up a significantif often transientpart of seat tles downtown population some of these men would also become the fathers of a generation of mixedancestry people diane vendiola was one of these her swinomish mother met her filipino father a laborer and boxer in seattle in the s according to vendiola it was nat ural for them to come together similar indianfilipino relationships resulted in the birth of a generation that would go on to shape seattle politics in the decades to come both bernie reyes whitebear founder of the united indians of all tribes and bob santos a leader in the city asianpacific islander community were what santos called indipinos in the working world of depressionera seattle new kinds of indian identities were being formed and the stage was being set for a new political landscape in the city finally the census includes the institutionalized indians of seat tle the men women and children of the city asylums at the sacred heart orphanage four young children from washington tribes includ ing the makah and sklallamjames henry angeline la belle and the siblings bernice and carl kavanaughappear in the rosters among their majority white compatriots at the king county hospital where fullblood yakama ernest spencer worked as a truck driver the list of native patients and their tribes is like a directory to seattle indian hinter land tlingit haida snohomish tsimshian canadian m√©tis these were also perhaps some of seattle poorest native people ranging in age from twenty to nearly sixty all but one of the hospitals indian patients were listed as unemployed this was also the case for cherokee harry marshall and siwash dorothy martin the two indian residents of the city jail these were men and women for whom life in the city had not been easy particularly in the lean years of the s census tables for the hospital and jail suggest that there were other native people in seattle in people the enumerators would have missed the homeless the transient and the seasonally migrant surely many of these hardertofind or easiertoignore indians existed invis ible to the census takers and except for people like ann peterson the makah woman who opened her ballard home to needy indians and the native neighbors whose presence shaped richard hugos class consciousness indian people were largely invisible in seattle urban landscape unlike the seattle of the s where wellknown indian enclaves existed on the lava beds and the waterfront in native people were integrated into the city poor and workingclass districts but had little public presence and unlike in when real indians and their canoes appeared matteroffactly in mr glovers drawing of the city living indian people were largely absent from the city self o n t h e c u s p o f p a s t a n d f u t u r e image indian images however were not the urban landscape in which these indian people lived had changed dramatically in only a few short decades through stories of chief seattle and doomed last indians and through the city encounter with its indian hinterland seattle had developed not only a new set of placestories but also a new land scape that was marked by indian symbols by the late s seattle had become a city of totems indian images guarded most approaches to the city on the west a totem pole stood on an overlook offering views of the city from duwam ish head while others graced the ship canal locks and the downtown waterfront on the north tourist establishmentsthe thunderbird hotel the totem pole motel and the twin teepees loungeused indian images to attract travelers motoring on the new pacific high way on the east visitors plying the stateoftheart floating bridge across lake washington entered a tunnel under the city hills by passing through a portal surrounded by northwest coaststyle designs and text that read seattle portal to the pacific along with the potlatches founders day events busts and seals and statues of chief seattle and other urban placestories the urban landscape itself spoke to the impor tance of indians as defining elements of seattle civic selfimage in pioneer place park at the heart of the city oldest neighborhood the chiefofallwomen pole that had been stolen from on the cot tonwood in remained the grandest and eldest of seattle indian icons but then just after pm on october an unidentified man placed gasolinesoaked rags against the base of the pole set the rags on fire and disappeared into the darkness to this day no one knows why but as seattleites decided how best to replace the irreparably dam aged artifact a clear distinction was made between indian imagery in the city and urban indians themselves at first two local suquamish men accomplished lumbermen employed by the works progress administration wpa were asked to carve the new pole however many observers feared that richard temple and lawrence webster the grandson of wahalchoo who had once dived for power off alki point might introduce some goofy innovations and one reporter who vis ited their homes across puget sound was disturbed to find that they spoke english fluently and even drove trucks ethnographer melville jacobs for his part argued that only his white colleague viola garfield could do the job right meanwhile the times solicited opinions from native people at a baseball game in north seattle only to find that these indians hardly seemed indian at all they were playing an american sport one of the men was carving a pole with teddy roosevelt on it and another suggested painting the pole with storebought paint instead of traditional pigments this was the standard kind of urbanversus indian history at work indians in the city were in fact no longer indi ans and native truckdrivers and ballplayers were ignorant and undeserving of the indianness the chiefofallwomen pole represented in the end the job was given to carvers at saxman in alaska some of whose ancestors had once lived in on the cottonwood in exchange for the remains of the original pole never mind that the carving of the replacement pole was sponsored by a federal agency the civilian con servation corps these were real indians not only because they came from a totem pole culture but because of their perceived distance from urban life faroff indians exotic and abstract were preferable to familiar ones who called seattle home and were the only ones deemed fit to hew sixty feet of freshlycarved monsters ferocious enough to set a lady tourist tittupy with horror despite this tension between seattle native imagery and its indian residents native people were sometimes active participants in the cre ation of the city indian iconography enumerators of the cen sus for example found a family from ucluelet on vancouver island living along the duwamish river not far from where seetoowathl and his wife had starved to death in like many other nuuchahnulth people simon peter his wife annie their grown son solomon and their younger children evelyn arthur and elsie had come to seattle in search of opportunity for solomon that meant hard work as a gen eral laborer on the docks and in the industrial areas of town but for simon work in the city meant carving totem poles which were then sold to places like ye olde curiosity shop for simon peter being urban and being indian were not necessarily in conflictin fact one facili tated the other this was also the case for jimmy john another nuu o n t h e c u s p o f p a s t a n d f u t u r e chahnulth from the community of mowachat on the west coast of van couver island john had traveled regularly to seattle with his family and often sold items he carved from wood and silver to ye olde curiosity shop and other tourist outlets one of his most lucrative opportuni ties however came in when he was hired by a curioshop owner to carve a series of totem poles that would be incorporated into the design of a new building by the misnamed haida house was doing a brisk business in baskets masks model canoes and miniature totem poles out of a building adorned with thunderbirds bears and eagles carved by john in return for room and board the haida housenow the totem house fish and chips shopwas part of a new s ver nacular that used totem poles tipis and other indian images to capture the attention of tourists but behind the seeming kitsch lay the labor and expertise of a native artisan for john who lived in seattle for ten years before returning to british columbia to become a leader in the renais sance of northwest coast art urban life provided not just economic oppor tunity but a chance to establish himself as a native artist and in doing so he helped craft seattle indian iconography in the late s though the shape of the city and of urban history itself was about to change the lean years in the city of totems were about to end as mobilization for global conflict dramatically transformed the city its population and its economy in later decades many of seat tles older residents as well as some of its historians would come to see the s as the last years of old seattle in a series of interviews conducted at the beginning of the twentyfirst century for example seattle residents who remembered depressionera seattlewealthy and poor black and white radical and conservativedescribed the traits that made seattle of the s so different from the city of later decades for wpa artist bill cumming broadcasting heiress patsy col lins unrepentant wobbly jesse petrich african american dietician mar ian valleylightner and puget power technician tom sandry seemingly intractable racial and social divisions radical politics and an economy still driven by extractive industries distinguished the s their descriptions of old seattle are exercises in nostalgia but they also reflect the very real transformations that took place during and after the second world war as the lean years came to an end for many of seattle residents so too did one era of the city history this was true for seattle indian history as well in the years sur rounding seattle had been on the cusp of an urban and indian revolution back then seattle illaheea mixedrace town on the urban indigenous frontierwas about to give way to a modern city of the changers that used native imagery to explain itself to the world that dispossessed local indigenous people and that spawned an indian hinterland in the s that imagery dispossession and hinterland remained largely in place but the beginnings of a new kind of urban indian history were visible as well stoney and choctaw women and men arriving from beyond the city regional hinterland a makah woman helping lost indian children and a hesquiaht carver using a job in the city to launch a native renaissance each helped lay the foundations for a new chapter in seattle indian and urban histories but in the s on the cusp between past and present indian people were often over shadowed by indian imagery when mac and ike the heroes of john dos passoss workingclass epic the nd parallel arrived in seattle for example their experiences there reflected not only the fears and aspi rations of the great depression but the landscape of urban conquest the next day was sunny the seattle waterfront was sparkling smelt of lum beryards was noisy with the rattle of carts and yells of drivers when they got off the boat they went to the ymca for a room they were through with being laborers and hobos they were going to get clean jobs live decently and go to school nights they walked round the city all day and in the evening met olive and gladys in front of the totempole sic on pioneer square of course they did o n t h e c u s p o f p a s t a n d f u t u r e mr glovers imbricated city i n the spring of the seattle daily intelligencer announced that a certain mr glover after making sketches the previous winter had completed a drawing of seattle supposed to be taken from a considerable elevation according to the newspaper the resulting birdseye view of the town was at once a map and a picture portray ing every street public building and private residence with extraor dinary accuracy nearly three feet wide the drawing included not just the city but its surroundings lakes washington and union basking in the summer sunlight and the cascade range towering over all the daily intelligencer also reported that glover and his business partner planned to embark on a campaign to print and distribute lithographs of the panorama to specific ends to those who subscribe liberally a very liberal allotment of pictures will be made and as they convey a truthful and accurate portrait of our city and harbor they will prove invaluable to friends afar off anxious to know what seattle is like to property owners the picture will also prove of the greatest value for circulation amongst investors there are hundreds of capitalists who would be only too glad to know of so genial a clime and so many natural advantages for a commercial city and where they could invest their money in good paying railroads and real estate the promoters of the view should be encouraged to perfect their arrangements immediately as the city never needed the picture more than at the present time in an era of intense competition among young northwestern cities glov ers portrait and its counterparts representing port townsend tacoma portland and other towns played critical roles in urban image making and in the pursuit of immigration and investment but panoramic city views from the nineteenth century usually bore little resemblance to the actual places they marketed instead in the words of one urban historian they depart from reality so as to empha size and exaggerate order progress prospects for future unlimited growth and other themes dear to the hearts of urban boosters thus one might expect seattle portrait to be a vision of the city as it wished itself to be a pastoral landscape surrounding an orderly grid of streets and a bustling harbor with little evidence of streets filled with thighdeep mud stumpcursed lots noxious effluents from mills and canneries or undesirable populations true to the genre the panorama did offer a pleasant idealized image of seattle that gave little indication of muck clearcuts fish guts or chinese board ing houses but look closely there along the waterfront among the steamers and the tall ships a small flotilla of dugout canoes approaches a native encampment on the shoreline at the heart of the city glovers birdseyeview indians were matteroffact parts of the urban land scape neither elided nor elevated and in fact as their inclusion in glovers urban imagination suggests real indian people still had a place in seattle social and economic life in despite the bostons efforts to craft boundaries between indians and settlers through laws lynch mobs and torches seattle remained a landscape where indians and settlers lived alongside each other their lives still woven tightly together when charles kinnear and his parents and siblings arrived a few months after glover unveiled his panorama they saw this shared land scape firsthand after buying a salmon from a native vendor for five cents through the window of their room in the occidental hotel kin near and his brother went out to explore their new home they soon came across an indian encampment with canoes pulled ashore and racks of salmon eggs curing over small fires stretching for more than three blocks along the waterfront as the boys watched more canoes arrived in a constant stream filled with freshly caught coho salmon and the m r g l o v e r s i m b r i c at e d c i t y indigenous men commenced to play slahal the bone game of strat egy and sleight of hand known throughout the northwest just beneath our station on the high bank were sixtythree longhaired nude indians all their clothes in one pile sitting in two lines facing each other boards on their laps stones in their hands beating the boards as they sang in the middle of each line was an indian chief with nothing on but a big red handkerchief around his neck in one hand was a pair of carved bones whichplaced under the handkerchiefwere changed from one hand to the other the closed fists then swinging outward again under the handkerchief back and forth and the opposing chief designated the hand supposed to be holding the bones both hands were then thrown upward the bones going from the hand not guessed and the score keep deposited a stone indicating the loss the bones then went to the opposite chief who made his trial bye and bye all arose the losing side sneaking along the beach to their wigwams the stack of clothes divided into as many piles as there were victorious indians thus the kinnear boys who would later become two of seattle most prominent citizens encountered the urban indigenous frontier of seattle illahee where fine hotels existed alongside racks of curing salmon roe and where a growing urban skyline contrasted with an oldfashioned bone game on the cobbles in front of it in whulshootseed there is a word yiq that describes the process of working designs of bear grass maidenhair fern or wildcherry bark onto the stunning woven baskets for which duwamish lake and shil shole women were renowned imbrication as anthropologists have named this process in english is by nature forceful with deerbone awls pressing into watertight cedar bark or spruce root to create imagesmountain ranges men rainpassed down through genera tions of weavers but the word has a second meaning as well yiq can also describe the process of working something into a tight place or as one elder described it worrying something into place what an apt metaphor then for the process by which the urban and indigenous worlds interacted within the landscape framed by glovers drawing with native and boston places and peoples woven together in a shared geog raphy with a weave that was often disturbingly tight seattle was an imbricated place it was also a place on a threshold before many indigenous people with roots in the landscape that was becoming seattle had remained there continuing to pursue subsistence activities and tradi tional cultural practices in and around town after the remain ing duwamish lake and shilshole people would face increasing pressures to leave the city both because of seattle sudden expansion around the turn of the century and because of federal allotment policy that encouraged them to move to area reservations meanwhile a new kind of native community would take shape in the city indigenous people from beyond puget sound having occasionally visited salt water in the past would now make seattle part of an annual cycle of migra tion leading to the formation of a multiethnic urban indian commu nity outnumbering the local indigenous population the year was also a turning point in the rhetorical place of native people in white seattle civic consciousness despite their portrayal as markers of urban disorder real indians played an important role in daily life during the village period but in the urban revolution that would take place between and actual native people would be overshadowed by symbolic indians in seattle urban imagination the matteroffact canoes on glovers waterfront would be replaced by imagined savages noble or otherwise and indian images would receive far more atten tion than indian people the moment captured by mr glover holds elements of both the past and the future weaving together two periods in seattle urban indian story on the ground the warp and woof of native and boston lives cre ated a shared landscape not just on seattle waterfront but through out the young city along the rivers and shorelines around it and just over the encircling hills seattle illahee was growing and the shared world that characterized the village period remained part of daily life nowhere is this clearer than in that record of all but the most invisible lives the federal census as intrepid enumerators moved through seat tle and its environs in the spring and summer of just two years after mr glover unveiled his drawing they captured in their forms and m r g l o v e r s i m b r i c at e d c i t y tables some of the details behind those canoes pulling up to the litho graphed beach they gave voices if only muffled ones to native people who called seattle home and their records along with other accounts of this moment in seattle history highlight the diversity of native expe riences within the urban weave and provide a glimpse into the com plexities of a developing urban indian population in the census indians tend to appear in groups suggesting that attempts to create spatial boundaries between whites and natives if not successful in banishing indians from the city altogether had at least resulted in a handful of small enclaves within seattle urban geog raphy one such enclave existed along the waterfront near the city cen ter and was home to several families of local indigenous people john and his wife stosach lived with the elderly goleeaspee the men both fished for a living while stosach was a washerwoman samson another fisherman lived with his wife julia while their neighbor moses likely the man whose son had died of smallpox three years before his body discovered in a tree trunk on the outskirts of town hunted to support his wife quitsalitsa and their daughters julia and amelia the best known resident of this enclave was kikisebloo or princess angeline the eldest daughter of seeathl and mother of betsy the woman who had committed suicide to escape her husbands abuse back in the s together these families represented the continued presence of local indigenous people in an urbanizing landscape who combined tradi tional resource use with opportunities afforded by the new urban econ omy one seattle resident recalled indian traders and vendors in the s writing of many indian canoes landing at the foot of seneca street and madison street and many indian women who brought us oolalies berries and clams and mallard ducks the small settlement where kikisebloo and the others lived was one site for these activities allowing local native people to maintain connections to places and resources that reflected preurban patterns of settlement meanwhile on the tidelands just south of yeslers sawmill and the lava beds another small enclave of indians reflected a growing pat tern in seattle at the beginning of the s the puget sound hops industry was reaching international prominence thanks in part to a devastating blight in europe in a seasonal circuit that would become part of seattle urban cadence in the years to come native people from british columbia alaska and elsewhere in washington territory trav eled to the fields of hops ripening in the valleys around seattle and typ ically included a stay in seattle listed mostly as laborers with the women listed significantly as keeping camp rather than keeping house the people the enumerator found on the tideflats were likely partway through this seasonal round indian wallace lived with indian jennie indian jack lived with indian sallie and indian peter and indian annie shared their camp with their son indian sam all were from british columbia nearby young indigenous alaskan women named indian kitty and indian rose camped with kittys infant son indian tommy while a camp close by sheltered indian jennie and indian john not unlike the chinaman john system of nomenclature that rendered asian immigrants anonymous in many historical records this indian naming practice relegated many native peopleparticularly those not connected to local families or communitiesto anonymity lacking even a tribal designation but their origins far from seattle suggested that a new kind of urban development the creation of a farreaching indian hinterland was under way and of course there were the lava beds here mixedrace house holds of white men and indian women existed among the saloons brothels and chinese hostels two such households were those of cook william milton who lived with british columbia native mary murphy and sailor george hill whose wife indian mary also hailed from the north as miltons and hills occupations suggest many of the white men in such relationships were on the lower rungs of the urban econ omy sometimes economic circumstances required mixedrace couples to share homes as unemployed laborer thomas scott and indian jen nie did with outofwork canadian james holt and ellen dillon holts indianhawaiian partner others such as julia lowar the daughter of an indigenous woman from washington territory and a french father who lived on the lava beds with joseph francis a hebridean laborer could afford to keep their own homes the backgrounds of couples like these also reflect patterns associated with the fur trade of previous m r g l o v e r s i m b r i c at e d c i t y decades many of the men were from canada or scotland while most of the women were of mixed parentage their fathers from france hawaii canada or the celtic fringe while some of the mixedrace households on the lava beds in appear to have been marriages if only √† la fa√ßon du pays considering the miscegenation laws of the time others hint at the reason this district was called the lava beds in the first place nova scotian barkeeper thomas asgood for example rented rooms to nancy mccarthy the daughter of a frenchman and a washington indian and to another indian mary this one a fullblood member of an unspecified native commu nity nearby louise woolene annie powers and maggie murphyall young mixedrace women likely from british columbialived above a tavern owned by welshman richard prichard and his partner william cheney nearby twentyfiveyearold indian katie hays boarded with barkeep george behan and his bartender thomas barry and native seventeenyearold nellie hilton roomed at the establishment of ger man immigrants jacob and mattie wirtz meanwhile cecilia thomas a twentynineyearold woman of hawaiian and british columbian indian descent was listed as the sole occupant of her household while specifics about each of these womens lives are lost to history it is quite possible that some or all of them participated at least casually in the sex trade for which the lava beds was reviled by seattle voices of urban order surely a number of indian women working in the sex trade were missed by the enumerators having avoided the census taker or hav ing been hidden by their employers pinnells illahee may have burned in but the sawdust womenwhether prostitutes or notwere still around urban indian enclaves along the waterfront and on the lava beds reflected civic leaders desires to segregate indigenous people from respectable settler society but the distinction between them broke down as native men and women went uptown to work in the homes of middleclass and elite white families in particular indian women played an important role as domestic servants and livein laborers in throughout seattle enumerators found young indian women living and working in the homes of white families fourteenyearold mixedrace hannah benson helped ministers wife mary whitworth keep house for her husband their civilengineer son fred and their daugh ter etta meanwhile nineteenyearold lois hilderbidle also the daugh ter of a white father and indian mother worked as a servant in the home of physicians alvin and herman bagley and hermans wife kitty how ever indian servants could also be found in more modest homes irish laborer john christopher and his wife bridget employed fifteenyear old boarder lizzie whitney a fullblood washington territory indian and singlemother henrietta minks a resident of the lava beds received muchneeded assistance from a british columbian woman known as indian kate nothing remains to illuminate why elizabeth fitzpatrick a young mixedrace woman chose to live with and work for mill owner george w stetsons family but we might guess money a bit of pres tige and a ticket off the reservation even a handful of young native men took advantage of such arrangements willie henry the fourteen yearold son of a nova scotian father and a local indian mother was living with james carpenter and family when the enumerator came to visit in writing in the s mrs e e heg a member of the trinity church congregation emphasized the importance of these indian domestic laborers to the white women of seattle during this time noting that the only kind of domestic help available in seattle came from native women she pointed out that such workers freed her and other epis copalian women to help organize seattle first parish highstatus indian women meanwhile were sometime employed by highstatus white fam ilies as in the case of kikisebloo who did laundry at the parsonage of the first presbyterian church throughout the s and whose impa tience with the ministers young children became something of a run ning joke in town her regular journeys between the indigenous enclave on the waterfront and the parsonage up the hill illustrate just how per meable boundaries were between white and native seattle it also sug gests a certain kind of congruency between two statusconscious societies highclass duwamish working for highclass boston indigenous fishermen hop pickers from alaska and british colum bia the saloon crowd and domestic servantsthese were the roles into m r g l o v e r s i m b r i c at e d c i t y which seattle urban indians were expected by their boston neighbors to fit each category came with its own respective space on the margins of society waterfront tideflat lava bed laundry room however few spatial expressions of power are pure or complete and elsewhere in seattle other indians and indian women in particular had become part of settler society not as washerwomen or campkeepers or lava bed wives but as members of mixedrace families scattered throughout seat tle there was jacob hardings wife lucy the daughter of washington territory and british columbia indians and jennie the british col umbian wife of german immigrant john drummerhouse an eight yearold mixedrace indian child named hattie perhaps adopted or perhaps a disturbingly young house servant lived with the logger fran cis guye and his wife eliza both of them white and andrew castro sixty years old shared a home with his twentytwoyearold native sisterinlaw annie and her son john age five the occasional marriage between a white man and a native woman appears in king countys official records as well the wedding between peter brown and an anonymous indian woman robert m stewarts marriage to helen an indian and the nuptials of louie henry and ellen hatlepoh suggest that the antimiscegenation laws of the s and s were only haphazardly implemented even though enumerators sched ules and marriage records tell us little about these people these brief glimpses of lives and perhaps even loves nonetheless speak to the ways that native and settler histories had become intimately interwoven pioneer daughter sophie frye bass recalled another mixedrace fam ily enumerated in the census that of john and mary kelly and their daughter maria living in an immaculately kept little house on fourth avenue between pike and pine streets washington territory born mary did laundry at home for her white neighbors while irish immigrant john was a skilled blacksmith maria fourteen in was a schoolmate and friend of young sophie frye and other settler chil dren once holding a potlatch by handing out candy hearts bearing inscriptions such as do you love me and be my girl like mr glovers birdseye view of seattle in which indigenous people were a part of everyday urban life memories of families like these attested to the ways in which everyday relations between indian and settler called into question those very categories the mixedrace family of maria kelly was just as much a part of settler society as that of sophie frye while indian and nonindian lives interwove at the finegrained level of the census schedule on a larger scale indian and nonindian spaces beyond the city limits were also beginning to interweave in after the slumps of the s and early s seattle at last began to grow in accordance with its founders imaginations leapfrogging over enclos ing hills marshes and waterways in the late s one newspaper editor described seattle growth spurt in a call for any doubters to go out over the hills to the real front of action and progress where they would see the signs of urban development fires smoking in the dis tance on every hill new roofs peeping out through vistas of vanishing foliage trim garden fences routing out the old logs and debris these changes in the landscape told the story of extending dominion and the beginning of the new regime of solid growth for seattle residents living on the outskirts this year noted one observer find themselves next year right in town this was no less true for native people living in and immediately around seattle as the city spread across the rugged landscape between puget sound and lake washington outly ing settlementsindigenous and settler alikewere imbricated into the urban fabric seattle sudden expansion in the late s took place on many fronts and often uncovered glimpses into the indigenous landscape it would soon obliterate to the south a terrible beach road broken and demor alized after each winters rains made its sloppy way past the oxbows and marshes of the river valley to the settlement of duwamish which had recently celebrated the opening of a lyceum a sure sign that change was on the way not far away county officials had chosen one of the finest pieces of land in the county over one hundred and sixty acres of land of a black alluvial character as the site of a farm and hospital for the poor and indigent previously leased by illahee entrepreneur john pinnell to several chinese truck farmers the farm stood on deep shell middens created by generations of indigenous harvests which explained the remarkably fertile soils m r g l o v e r s i m b r i c at e d c i t y meanwhile to the north urban outposts seemed to be springing up everywhere in belltown immediately north of seattle along elliott bay boasted sixtyeight houses one school a grocery and a boarding house for shipbuilders while more houses were under construction as the townscape took form builders often unearthed bodies wrapped in cedar bark the remains of an indigenous cemetery at lake union quite a town now surrounded david dennys sawmill with close to two hundred residents after a sidewalk was built to the lake from seat tles northern city limit in following the route of an indigenous trailresidents expected streetcars water lines and the villas of our wealthy townsmen to follow in short order to the northwest families had begun clearing land around salmon bay in and by farms could be found along both sides of the bay with a population sufficiently numerous to sustain a district school and to the northeast along the nolongerdistant shores of lake washington families began staking claimsand more importantly moving to themin the late s banking on an eventual canal connecting the lake with puget sound here was seattle first urban sprawl and it caught both native people and native places in its weave the duwamish river offered evidence of an indigenous past in the middens at the county farm but it also offered evidence of an indigenous present in the form of several large indigenous settlements along its banks in belltown where growth dis turbed graves living native people camped along the beach near where longhouses had once stood amid gardens of salal at salmon bay where a dozen shilshole families had been living in the s some still remained doctor jim manly finelooking and intelligent according to one observer lived at the mouth of the bay near where hwelchteed known to most settlers as salmon bay charlie owned ten acres mean while in the salmon bay settlement itself alonzo hamblet managed the west coast improvement company while his tsimshian daughter inlaw mary concerned herself with the local church and the scheur mann familys ten childrenalong with those of other mixedrace families like the ryersons and tollenshelped fill the seats at the small schoolhouse to the east on lake washington native people camped on union bay with the permission of settler joe somers while close by chesheeahud called lake union john and dzakwoos also known as indian jim zackuse worked their respective five and ten acres at the eastern end of lake union and south of there indian jack and his wife eliza owned an acre in columbia city a new suburb at the head of a slough along the lake some of these native men and women like mary hamblet or those camping in west seattle on their way to the hop fields were new to seattle themselves emigrants in search of urban opportunity others like chesheeahud and dzakwoos were local people with attachments to local places these were the indians that an daily intelligencer reported had severed their tribal relations taken homesteads quit their nomadic life and gone to farming and who didnt care to lose their places on account of unpaid taxes far from vanishing these were indige nous people who had chosen to stay near traditional territories and make a go of it in an urbanizing landscape and although they had severed tribal relations according to american law they and their homes would remain important landmarks for indigenous people traveling to and from the city however staying in the old places was getting more and more difficult in the urban imbrication was getting tighter as indigenous towns turned into poor farms burial grounds became basements and fishing sites became waterfront real estate for some native people the pres sures were simply too much doctor jim the healer living at the mouth of salmon bay was one of these like many other indigenous doctors in puget sound much of his social standing had been swept away by epidemics and american medical practices unlike some though doc tor jim had become fluent in english and had chosen to live close to the settlers but things reached a breaking point for doctor jim one morning in when he hanged himself in his house within sight of the old shilshole town of tucked away inside as bad as things had gotten for doctor jim the challenges facing indigenous people in and around seattle were small in comparison to what was to come in many ways was a brief interlude between two dark periods in seattle indian history the chaotic violence of ear lier decades had largely quieted the epidemics had waned and the legal m r g l o v e r s i m b r i c at e d c i t y ity of native homesteading allowed for some semblance of indepen dence and economic stability but the urban ambition reflected in mr glovers birdseye drawing of seattle and the changes attendant to it were about to reach new heights and indigenous people who had wor ried themselves into the tight weave of the city rapidly urbanizing land scape would face challenges on a completely new scale fire water and iron would soon change everything an atlas of indigenous seattle coll thrush and nile thompson maps by amir sheikh historical introduction by coll thrush answering the question what happened here requires asking another what was here before in seattle as in most cities the preurban landscape has been transformed almost beyond recognition tracing the course of the duwamish river as it was in for example can be a daunting task understanding the ways in which indigenous people inhabited that landscape meanwhile can be even more difficult in short there is virtually nothing left to seeearlier generations of seat tleites made sure of thatand so comprehending the city indigenous geography involves peeling back decades of development and imag ining the possibilities even then the risk remains that we will imag ine only what we expected to see all alongnoble savages empty wilderness totem polesrather than what might have actually once been there seattle native pasts have been full of such imaginings luckily through the work of two men and the indian people who collaborated with them we have a rare opportunity to envision in specific concrete ways the places that would eventually become seattle in the s both men collected information about traditional indigenous geographies of the seattle area working both with duwamish men and women living in and around the city and with muckleshoot and suquamish inform ants from area reservations the first of these researchers was thomas talbot waterman a student of franz boas waterman taught anthropology and sociology at the university of washington in the early twentieth century although he lived in seattle for only a handful of years the city held a special fascination for him the actual topography is very interesting he noted and the spot is doubly interesting because of the great city which has grown up there even better though the urban landscape that had grown up on central puget sound was still popu lated by indian people some of them like seetoowathl in his float house shared their knowledge with him from within the city limits others like jennie davis and amelia sneatlum from suquamish and betsy whatcom from muckleshoot educated him in their reservation homes the resulting manuscript entitled puget sound geography includes the names of hundreds of places from the cascade mountains in the east to the western shores of puget sound and from whidbey island in the north to the manyarmed southern reach of the sound the names speak about the everyday practices of life here places where fish were caught places where canoes could be portaged places where games were played they tell of the landscapes intellectual elements the con nections between bodies houses and the earth ways of measuring the land and moving on the waters spirit forces that gave life meaning most importantly they are proof of the profound inhabitedness of this first country the towns the trails the stories from deep time watermans work did have its problems he often misunderstood the elders and sometimes failed to obtain the meanings of the place names he was offered and his maps are consistently bad his great est error though was in the attitude he brought to his research noting for example that indigenous people on puget sound might have twenty names for places along a river but no name for the river as a whole waterman commented that from our own standpoint the indians conception of the size of the world is startlingly inadequate water man saw indigenous people as his intellectual inferiors inhabiting a lower rung on the ladder between savagery and civilization to strengthen this point waterman compared for example placenaming practices among the peoples of the pacific some polynesian societies had names only for small places while others like the samoans had achieved a national and archipelagic designation it was clear which societies waterman found to be more civilized while his work is a testament to the richness of indigenous inhabitance in seattle and puget sound it is also an example of the kind of thinking that placed indians in the category of primitiveand that justified their dispossession for all its biases the biggest problem with puget sound geogra phy has been its inaccessibility available for decades only in the ban croft library berkeley a photocopy of the unfinished manuscript was obtained by the university of washington in the s despite its poor quality outdated and inconsistent orthography and chaotic strike throughs and marginalia the university of washington copy has been a boon both to archaeologists and to historians but has remained inac cessible and unusable to all but the most intrepid or formally educated researchers in the s upper skagit tribal member vi hilbert anthropologist jay miller and amateur linguist zalmai zahir edited the manuscript putting the elders words into modern orthography trans lating a number of placenames that waterman had not and most importantly linking the work to presentday efforts to reawaken the indigenous language of the region even though their edition was pub lished in the information remained relatively inaccessible because the limited printing run of this latest incarnation of watermans research meant that it was expensive and difficult to find the present atlas builds on the work of hilbert and her colleagues but also returns to the original waterman manuscript in an effort to expand the num ber of translations and to correct past mistranslations in addition to the material gathered by waterman this atlas makes use of certain field notes of john peabody harrington heav ily influenced while at stanford university by the work of the renowned anthropologist a l kroeber harrington began graduate studies in germany but soon dropped out to become a high school teacher in california using his summers off to conduct fieldwork in he came to seattle to teach summer courses in linguistics and northwest coast ethnology at the university of washington as well as to conduct a series of public lectures entitled the siberian origin of the ameri can indian during the summer of he conducted fieldwork with duwamish people including hereditary duwamish chief william rogers on the suquamish reservation rogers an indian man named moore and the informant and interpreter edward percival joined har a n at l a s o f i n d i g e n o u s s e at t l e rington on visits to the seattle and renton area contributing the place names included in this atlas this research along with his more exten sive work on the last speakers of several california languages brought harrington to the attention of the bureau of american ethnology which hired him as an ethnographer in over the next four decades harrington went on to collect materials on more than a hundred additional indigenous languages of north america and became a pioneer of linguistic recordings reclusive and eccentric harrington received little academic recognition during his life but after his death his colleagues discovered enormous amounts of field notes squirreled away in garages and storage units up and down the west coast these field notes have supplied subsequent generations of scholars with remarkable insights into languages and cultural prac tices that are now lost also unlike waterman harrington rarely made explicit written judgments about native societies but appears to have had a deep appreciation for the sophistication of indian languages tech nologies and cultures except where noted the information in this atlas comes from the original waterman and harrington materials the field notes and plat maps of the general land offices cadastral survey conducted in the s a list of villages and longhouses that was an exhibit in a s land claims case and erna gunthers classic ethnobotany of western washington unless noted otherwise archaeological data come from the database held and maintained by the university of washingtons burke museum of natural history and culture in many cases additional information about the history of specific sites can be found within the main text of the book we have chosen somewhat arbitrarily to limit the scope of the atlas to seattle current boundaries with a handful of exceptions in which a site immediately outside the city limits was impor tant to understanding places within seattle eg entries or where a site spoke directly to the broader themes of this book eg entry the concerns of presentday tribal peoples dictate how this atlas should be used despite the tumult of regrades and ship canals arti facts of seattle indigenous past surely remain undisturbed through out the city with that in mind the maps have been created at a scale that prevents the specific location of individual sites we have also with held mention of ancestral burial sites or of indigenous remains that have been found in the city but should a reader inadvertently unearth something or someone while digging a basement or clearing brush a call to the tribes or to the burke museum should be the first response not just because it is the right thing to do but because it is in keeping with any number of state and federal laws finally although many eld ers once said that sacred sites in seattle had lost their power due to urban development some are being used again today and should be treated with respect just as this is not a pot hunters or grave robbers guide to seattle it is also not a primer for playing indian in the city maps are risky things publishing this information lays bare tradi tional knowledge and in doing so risks intrusion upon the intellectual and cultural rights of modern tribal people but there is also another kind of risk getting the history wrong the tighter the geographical focus the less clear the information tends to be the result is an atlas that includes conjecture speculation and goingsout on various limbs in the interest of imagining the possibilities of course the simple fact that in many cases this geography is speculativethe untranslatable words the mysterious meanings the unclear uses of placesis a result of the history described in this book it is part of the historical silence created by epidemics dispossession and forced assimilation waterman himself fretted about how much had already been lost when he was collecting the placenames nearly a century ago on puget sound alone there seem to have been in the neighborhood of ten thou sand proper names i have secured about half this number the remain der having passed out of memory i am continually warned by indians that they give me for my maps only a small part of the total number which once was used the rest they have either forgotten or never heard the old people could have told you all is the remark most commonly heard the math is offwaterman and his students collected less than percent of the names he claimed must have existedbut the point stands so much was lost prior to the s that we are bereft the view offered by watermans informants looks out on only a tiny fraction of the richness that was once here considering the power of what we do a n at l a s o f i n d i g e n o u s s e at t l e have the reality must have been staggering instead of just over ten dozen names for seattle we might have had a thousand if only history had worked out differently that said the maps that follow are not intended as a complete or comprehensive survey of seattle indigenous geography rather they are mere glimpses of what was here before the final risk of maps such as these is that they might give the impres sion that such geographies were static and unchanging this was surely not the case especially in a geologically ecologically and culturally dynamic place such as puget sound even before the arrival of the denny party and others the indigenous maps of this place surely changed over time as sites and their uses changed instead of a stable zero datum on which the rest of seattle history takes place it is perhaps more accu rate to think of this atlas as merely a partial snapshot of the indigenous world just prior to white settlement it is also useful to consider the other maps that could be made to represent seattle diverse native pasts the locations of mixedrace and indian families in seattle neighbor hoods the installations of totem poles in the city and the geographies of skid road each of these landscapes couldand perhaps should be mapped as well and interleaved with the maps presented here for an even fuller accounting of the erasures ironies and persistences that make up the palimpsest that is seattle history i hope these maps are a step in that direction linguistic introduction by nile thompson how a given community defines its landscape through placenames has long held a fascination for many anthropologists the vocabulary used as such is viewed as a window for understanding how a given soci ety defines its place in the world certainly traditional names have more appeal than todays urban nomenclature such as the seattle center or sixtythird street the placenames of the puget sound salish peoples have a wide range of reference from myth to human activity from spirit power to animal species and from natural resource to natural landmark a site could be named in isolation or it could be contrasted with other like features the placenames themselves can refer to broad expanses or areas or to specific sandspits or rocks along the coastline places were generally named from the perspective of looking toward the shore from puget sound the following whulshootseed placenames are written in a practi cal alphabet designed to be part of a writing system for use by speak ers of english a number of the sounds of whulshootseed are found in english and are written the same for example b d g h j l p s t w and y other sounds are specific to certain usages in english or are combination letters composed of two parts like their counterparts in english a as in ma when stressed ie √° often as in cedar when unstressed ie a ch as in chew dz as in rods ee usually as in meet but it can shift to being like the vowel in day when next to a back consonant q qw xw or gw as in gwen k the front k of english in keep kw as in queen oo usually as in shoot but it can shift to being like the vowel in hoe when next to a back consonant q the back k of english in cool qw as in quote sh as in ship ts as in cats u as in hut as in the middle of uh oh in addition to not using the czech and greek letters found in techni cal linguistic alphabets this practical alphabet makes use of capitalization rather than apostrophes to show glottalization most glottalized sounds b ch d k kw l p q qw ts w and y are the same as their a n at l a s o f i n d i g e n o u s s e at t l e nonglottalized counterparts except that they are pronounced with an explosion of pressure built up at the back of the mouth a few of the remaining sounds require a bit more explanation hl a breathy l produced by blowing air along the area the tongue tip is touching tl like the tl in atlantic if the initial vowel alone makes the first sylla ble an explosion of air pressure ie glottalization accompanies the start of the next syllable x a raspy sound made by raising the back of the tongue and rushing air around where it meets the roof of the mouth as found in some german dialects for ch the s prefix in a number of placenames eg and merely signifies that the word is a noun other prefixes are used when the same root is used in a verb the symbols sh and sh distin guish between a single sound and the s prefix preceding a root that begins with an h in which case it is two distinct sounds while word roots in the whulshootseed language usually have dis tinct meanings certain suffixes by their very nature are ambiguous these are called lexical suffixes because they contain meaning rather than refer to a grammatical relationship they can also influence the meaning of the accompanying root the following table of lexical suffixes that appear in seattle placenames shows that a number of these suffixes can differ in meaning depending on whether they are used in an anatomical geographic shaperole or object reference any of which is possible in placenames this list is preliminary and is not intended to be exhaustive it is interesting for example that no seattle placename is formed with the suffix adach beach some of the lexical suffixes are clearly compounds formed by combining two of them the suffix ap requires some explanation because most english speak ers might be inclined to view it as referring to head rather than bottom in regard to a river ap refers to the lower end where it drains out but in terms of an inlet the suffix refers to the end farthest from the mouth there are a number of other reoccurring morphemes or word parts other related suffixes meaning water include alqoo ahlqoo and ayqw anatomical geographic shaperole object abats body cylindrical object tree trunk absh people achee hand branch adee ear thing attached sound noise to the side ahl little object baby alee place altxw house ap rear end tail bottom end thing at base of inlet apsub neck throat isthmus aqs nose spit point pointed object of land aqw water liquid

mouth of waterway opening language qeed head summit thing on top shud foot lower leg supporting object weehl conveying object canoe was ribs object across in these placenames for example the compound prefix bas in entries and means it has and indicates that the site contains or is home to the creature or object presented in the remainder of the word addi tionally the prefix dxw pronounced similar to the tw in twilight means place although both the waterman and harrington listings are problem atic with the glosses of some words not matching the transcriptions the coast salishan reference books available today allow further refinement of their combined list many times eg and what appear to be remarks of their knowledgeable informants turn out to actually be accu rate translations of otherwiseproblematic placenames thus some of the riddles of previous versions have fallen by the wayside one humorous error in harrington that has been perpetuated until now is the listing of the name for ballard as h√°t hat here harrington and his informant miscommunicated because the puget sound salish lan guage is one of the few in the world that lack nasal consonants in reg ular speech the word given x√°txat actually means the duck mallard rather than the placename ballard northeast page northwest page southwest page southeast page map northwest the four european compass points were not necessarily the most impor tant directions in puget sound indigenous life while indigenous people recognized east and west as the places the sun rose and set and north and south as places that sent different kinds of weather orien tations such as landward seaward downriver and upriver were just as important if not more so similarly early settlers on puget sound had a sense of direction quite different from that of modern residents like indigenous people the first generation of settlers experienced this region from the water and so for them traveling south to olympia meant going up the sound while returning to the north meant going downsound imagine then that we are on a landward journey up the sound visit ing first the territory of the shilshole people and then moving into the outlying lands and waters of the duwamish proper salt water xwulch theodore winthrops travel narrative the canoe and the saddle used the anglicized form of this word to denote both indian whulgeamish and yankee whulgers who lived along the sound correctly using the whulshootseed change of ch to j before vowelinitial suffixes in the century and a half since this word for puget sound spelled in various ways has occasionally resurfaced most notably in the wellknown series of guidebooks profiling hikes and other excursions around the sound published by the mountaineers blackcaps on the sides ch√°lqwadee this placename refers to the blackcap rubus leucodermis a native fruit whose berries and shoots were harvested around the shores of this small lake now known as bitter lake blackcaps on

access to or from their village lying curled up ch√∫tqeedud lit tip brought up to the head watermans informant described this small sandspit at the site of the shilshole marina as lying curled like a pillow and noted that it was well known as a place for gathering fine clams hanging on the shoulder keehlalabud like many of the placenames around seattle and throughout puget sound this one for the knoll at the north end of the railroad crossing of salmon bay uses language of the body to describe the land mouth of shilshole shulsh√≥√≥lootseed the narrow mouth of salmon bay takes its name from the indigenous community at entry one of watermans informants described the passage through here as like shoving a thread through a bead this statement probably reflects the lack of navigable water longtime bal lard families report that prior to the building of the locks one could wade through the water at the mouth of salmon bay at low tide tucked away inside shulsh√≥√≥l this large village was the home of the shilshoolabsh or shilshole people who had two large longhouses here each by feet and an even greater potlatch house devastating raids by north coast tribes in the early nineteenth century may explain both the name which harrington described as going way inland and the villages location inside salmon bay despite settlement by nonindians some shilshole people remained here until the construction of the hiram m chittenden locks in the early twentieth century while others became part of the community of ballard or moved to area reservations relatively little is known about this settlement as construction of the locks destroyed most of it in the s in the s however archaeologist a g colley conducted an excavation of the western part of the site where the wakes of canal bound boats had been wearing away several feet of shoreline every year he found tools made of antler stone bone and even iron spirit canoe power butud√°qt the power that resided in this creek allowed indigenous doctors to reach the world of the dead to recover the souls of ailing or troubled people doctor jim who hung himself on salmon bay in likely was connected with the creek which by then had

members of the modern snoqualmie tribe had a homestead here until the s lowered promontory skw√≠tsaqs the top of lake union seems an odd place for a low name but the word for this place most likely refers to the points relationship to the surrounding and much higher landscape long before white settlers envisioned a canal linking lake washington and lake union indige nous people used this corridor to travel between the backcountry and the sound marsh sp√°hlaxad the wetlands on the south shore of portage bay must have been a fine place for hunting waterfowl chesheeahud or lake union

earthquakes and rising sea levels transformed the point indigenous people continued to use it to process fish and shellfish of particular importance are the trade items found here petrified wood from the columbia river obsidian from the arid interior and carved stone jewelry from british columbia all attesting to farreaching networks of commerce although this deeptime settle ment seems to have been forgotten by watermans twentiethcentury informants during the nineteenth century the site served as home to dispossessed duwamish indians waterman was told that the name described the act of pushing or thrusting ones way through brush or the opening of leaf budsapt similes for the way the point emerges from the thickly wooded bluffs that overhang it spring b√≥√≥lats harrington collected

that have destroyed a number of homes near here cold creek tl√≥√≥xwahlqoo lit cold freshwater this is a small creek flowing off the magnolia bluffs that may have been a reliable source of freshwater for travelers on the sound there is some disagreement between waterman and harrington regarding this site and that of entry below waterman seems to have confused meanings and words transposing this name to the other site but giving it that sites meaning such discrepancies attest to the imperfect nature of the process by which the two ethnographers gathered their data covered by covering l√©√©pleepahlaxw and rock ch√∫tla now known as four mile rock this massive glacial erratic sits at the foot of magnolia bluffs the meaning of one of its names appears to refer to a story about the boulder according to oral tradition a hero named stakoob once took a huge net woven of cedar and hazel and cast it over this rock from the far side of the sound the other name is purely descriptive

lake union then caught in the net here one of harringtons informants percival had camped here regularly before the site was urbanized and recalled that a small creek ran yearround at the site this placename can also describe someone who is constipated little prairie bab√°qwab or large prairie b√°qwbaqwab indian witnesses in a land claims case in the s identified this place as the site of two

twentieth century the belltown shoreline was an important camping place for native people including migrants from alaska british columbia and washingtons outer coast sour water schapaqw harrington collected this name for a hole in the sand that could be seen at low tide about two blocks north of the foot of pike street his inform ants told him that the hole was believed to connect via an underground channel to lake union young whales were said to have swum through the tunnel to the lake a similar story is told about entry and in fact stories of such subterranean waterways abound throughout the region spring b√≥√≥lats this spring located on what would become arthur dennys homestead was likely a less important source of freshwater for indigenous people since it had the same

company seattle first municipal water supply which was organized in grounds of the leaders camp qulx√°qabeexw this placename is said by harrington to be the chief place and another name for seattle most likely this was the name for a camp of a man known as either kelly or seattle curley soowalt who was the head man of the duwamish village in what is now downtown seattle he was a brother of seeathl his camp was located between columbia and cherry streets and first and second avenues by one source but closer to seneca or spring by others this camp also appears in the phelps map of the

here only the ruins of one remained when seattle was founded in waterman penned his informants description of the site as fol lows in the vicinity of the present king street station in the city of seattle there was formerly a little promontory with a lagoon behind it on the promontory were a few trees behind this clump of trees a trail led from the beach over to the lagoon which gave rise to the name there was an indian village on each side of this promontory flounders were plentiful in the lagoon this the tidal marsh is exactly where the king street station now stands according to other informants who worked with amateur ethnographer arthur ballard this village was located at the foot of yesler way if that were the case the name would refer to the trail that crossed over the hill to lake washington in what is now the leschi neighborhood pioneer daughter sophie frye bass described a second trail that came down to the sound here from the renton area it straggled on to rainier valley and approximately along rainier avenue then zig zagged across jackson main and king streets to salt chuck water a n at l a s o f i n d i g e n o u s s e at t l e until at least the second world

coastline and curving around into the estuary of the duwamish river these waters connected the duwamish people with not only other puget sound salish tribes such as the suquamish and snohomish but also more distant coast salish groups like the twana of hood canal then we enter the lower valley of the duwamish river where the intensity of environmental transformation is matched by the intensity

the offshore potential for the tipping of a canoe rids the cold t√∫sbud lit implement for ridding cold while the name of this site may be a reference to the battle of the winds described at entries since the fleeing north wind was known to have alighted briefly at other places along the sound it is more likely a reference to the bricks that were made out of clay here by settlers very early in seattle development native people would certainly have been aware of the insulating properties of brick even if they could rarely afford to build their houses out of the new material wealth spirit

intensively faunal remains from that period were overwhelmingly those of salmon but also included dogfish cod grebes deer seals mussels clams octopuses elderberry and wild onions after the earthquake the site was higher and drier and became a permanent settlement surrounded by forest muckleshoot informants in the s recalled hearing of three houses located here on the west bank of the river each feet wide by feet long although the site appears to have been abandoned during the epidemics of the s the name refers to a type of woven hat worn by yakama women suggesting trade networks across the

containing three hills in the presentday south park neighborhoodis named was identified by local informants in two ways as an eel or as a long green beach worm that inhabits driftwood and can be used

at t l e marks in indigenous mythology being the site of an epic battle between great forces of nature although this hills name was translated by water man as beaver the name he recorded is actually the diminutive form of the word for a mean person a fitting description given the story recounted below in addition to their mythic significance the hills here served a more practical purpose as places to keep watch for friends and enemies muckleshoot elder dosie wynn recalled that her grandmother had told her they climbed up on them rocks and they had scouts indian scouts and they could look out from there today the boeing access road exit from interstate crosses over part of this hill and airport way cuts deep through its core in what must have been a very expen sive offramp north wind st√≥√≥buloo there are many versions of the epic associated with this part of the duwamish valley most however focus on a great battle between north wind a force of cold and betrayal and the meanie of entry and storm wind who ultimately vanquished north wind and helped establish the presentday climate this place located on the hillside to the west of the river was the site of north winds ancient village the epic suggests the persistence of deeply held memories stretching back to the retreat of the great ice sheets barrier qul√°xad a ridge of stone in the riverbed visible at low tide from the footbridge at south th street is all that remains of north winds ice weir which had once kept salmon from swimming upstream to storm winds people according to one version of the story the barrier also served as a demarcation of territory during the myth period when trespassers were hanged after north wind fled the area the portion of his fish weir that was not washed away in a flood was turned to stone in the postcontact period the same word by which this site was known was used for fence or stockade beaver stuq√°xw lit dammer this second hill is associated both with the story of the winds described above and a story about beavers given below local indian people have maintained the memory of these hills and their stories despite dramatic changes to the landscape also known locally as poverty hill the site has recently been preserved eventually interpretive signs and restored native plantings will highlight the valleys rich history and ecology little north wind st√≥√≥tooblu this was a small rock on the west side of the river above and down hill from it was usually submerged but during low tide it was out of the water this tidal fluctuation mimics that portion of the myth in which north wind kept setting his daughter by the river every time he did so the water would rise because her icy earrings would melt caused to be burnt or blackened sqwulads the name of this place refers to dark striations on the hill in the epic story associated with this region raven the slave of north wind perched above south winds grandmother whose house was on this stone mountain and defecated down on her the paintlike marks on the hillside represented her face covered with the filth of raven and her own frozen tears this hill and beaver also feature in a story about a battle between beaver and five brothers one of them imbued with thunder power which split a single eminence into these two hills indigenous people also claimed that splashing a canoe paddle in the river here or pouring water against the hillside would bring rain today the north end of the hill has been quarried away and replaced with an office park while a new housing development covers its southern slope and highway separates the hill from the river muckleshoot elder bena williams told an interviewer that when they started having a quarry there then i dont think anybody goes there anymore a n at l a s o f i n d i g e n o u s s e at t l e unclean rock squl√©√©ls described as unclean in the sense of impure or bad rather than sim ply unwashed this location just a hundred yards upstream from beaver is

inside place dxwduw the region farther upstream away from the open saltwater was known as inside for its location inland off puget sound this word is the base of the term duwamish the valley where the black cedar and whitegreen rivers came together to form the duwamish was a center of indigenous settlement there were towns here named meeting of the rivers crags little cedar river and confluence and the area also became an important refuge for local native people during seattle urban development today only the green river flows through this area becoming the duwamish below the former confluence

the s noses squb√°qst jutting out into lake washington the bailey peninsula is home to seward park and some of seattle oldest trees the name likely refers to the fact that the peninsula which would

changesitsface was enor mous had retractable horns that resembled an elks antlers could also live in the sky and could see in all directions young people were warned to reject this spirit if at all

the lake washington shoreline map northeast besides being home to the lake people lake washington was also a transition to the duwamish backcountry the people living near the headwaters of the sammamish watershed the sammamish river enters lake washington from the northeast were often regarded as lower class by their neighbors in part because they had direct access neither to the riches of puget sound nor to trade routes across the cascades nothing captures this sense of backwoodsness more than the phrase used by coastal people to admonish an illbred child or an adult with bad taste by

now seattle but had been extirpated by the time white settlement reached the shores of lake washington chopped xeetl or gnawed xeetl√©√©l two slightly different names were collected for the shoreline south of madison park watermans name chopped probably refers to dense forest that would have provided fine timber for canoes and house posts harringtons version however refers to things that have been gnawed and his informant figured that there must have been beavers here prior to the excesses of the fur trade beavers shaped the landscape nearly as much as their indigenous human neighbors by creating ponds and wetlands it has skate fish baskw√©√©kweehl skates as a saltwater species did not live in lake washington this name more likely refers to the low flat shape of the land here at what

the lake to puget sound and lake washington in the s a settler named john pike began dig ging a canal here by hand and for a time there was a small log flume that connected the two lakes indigenous people had been crossing this isthmus for centuries either carrying their canoes or shoving them along an intermittent creek that appeared when lake washing ton overflowed general land office surveys from the s show a wellworn indian trail just north of here approximately where the burkegilman trail is now and oral tradition cites another trail to the south with all this traffic then one wonders if the idea of the union of lakes and sound was really thomas mercers after all little canoe channel shloow√©√©hl lit little canoe hole bearing the diminutive form of the name of entry this was an

work in the mill drying house shabaltxw exposed to the sun and to winds off the lake this point would have been an ideal place for drying salmon in open frame structures waterman noted that his indian

any emi grant handbook that the miners sang of seattle illahee is fitting on a literal level it was the name of one of the towns primary economic ventures the illahee was a brothel staffed mostly by native women many of them most likely from british columbia on a more symbolic level however illahee a chinook jargon term meaning country or place or home suggested a truth about everyday life in early seattle it was as much an indigenous place as a settler one david kellogg who arrived in seat tle in the s could have told you that decades later he described early seattle as a very small village really more indian than white it was a place where indians dominated the young urban landscape along the beach stretched the shanties with the inevitable canoes wrote kellogg some hauled high onto the beach and covered with mats while the smaller ones lay idly at the waters edge ready for immediate use every polackly night the singing and pounding in the shanties was the mighty orison during its village period an era stretching from the denny partys move to little crossingover place in to the coming of the railroad in seattle was indeed a native place indigenous people came to town throughout those decades both to continue long standing traditions and to make bids for inclusion in urban life per haps most importantly they came to work and indian labor would facilitate much of seattle early development it would also challenge federal indian policy as civic leaders enacted indian policies of their own that often ran counter to the ambitions of a weak national gov ernment well after the treaties and the indian war that would erupt between some settlers and some native people in and the presence of native people in town continued to shape civic politics as indians became signifiers of urban disorder in the eyes of many of seattle leading citizens seattle illahee was a perfect name for a place where indigenous peopleboth as participants in the towns successes s e at t l e i l l a h e e and as scapegoats for its problemswere at the core of life on the urban frontier w hen new settlers arrived in the little mill town on elliott bay they were often shocked by the large num bers of duwamish lake and shilshole people in and around seattle alonzo russell came in and recalled years later that like any boy of fourteen my first impressions of seat tle were of the thousands of indians standing by caroline leighton the wife of an early customs collector came in and in a florid diary entry from april of that year wrote the frogs have begun to sing in the marsh and the indians in their camps how well their voices chime together she also described a small stream of freshwater that cascaded down a gully into the lagoon at seattle once that stream had been a water source for the longhouses of little crossingover place fifteen years later the stream still served native people as they came to town and replaced little crossingover place with a bustling new community that existed alongside and enmeshed with the bostons only a small and insignificant village in the eyes of arrival dil lis ward seattle was dominated by indigenous people who made it their own using the new protourban venue with its connections to new trade networks new forms of political and spiritual power and new audiences to enact and even enhance economic political religious and social tra ditions continuous streams of both water and history flowed here all around the fledgling town indian people insisted on inclusion in settler society when a wedding united the mapel and van asselt families in seeathl and several hundred of his people arrived to observe the festivities along the duwamish river after dinner the new lyweds stood on display while native men and women filed by to look at them afterward seeathl and others began a celebration of their own on a sandspit at the mouth of the duwamish and mapel recalled that all that was good in the power of the spirits was called upon and invoked as a blessing for henry van asselt more than simply the marriage of two settlers the wedding was a meeting of two cultures with both mak ing a performance out of it in allowing the indians to gaze in awe at the white klootchman the settlers defined themselves as superior newcomers in a land of primitives meanwhile in their finery and solem nity seeathl and his retinue similarly defined themselves as highclass people and the mapelvan asselt wedding was not unusual indige nous ceremony was a key element of seattle urban scene during its first decades linking native tradition with new circumstances caro line leighton described a gathering to sing and dance spirit powers on the seattle shoreline in a little gray old woman appeared yesterday morning at our door with her cheeks all aglow as if her young blood had returned besides the vermilion lavishly displayed on her face the crease at the parting of her hair was painted the same color every article of clothing she had on was bright and new i looked out and saw that no indian had on any thing but red even old blind charley whom we had never seen in any thing but a black blanket appeared in a new one of scarlet this example of native people maintaining traditional cultural prac tices in the new setting of a mill town is a powerful challenge to the notion that seattle indian history was coming to a close when half the town showed up dressed in red it was clear that seattle was still a good deal indigenous but if some indigenous people pursued traditional ceremonies in town others came to seattle to access the new spirit power that lived there jesus christ one native woman named sally said to be a sister of seeathl was well known around town for her church attendance and in fact strove to build friendships only with churchgoing white women meanwhile ben solomon born at little crossingover place before the longhouses were abandoned and the wild roses took over became a figure in the local roman catholic congregation and after his first com munion built a chapel near the large native towns on the black river south of seattle weddings and other ceremonies offered venues for cultural encounter in seattle but all too often the collision of indigenous religious obser vance with the norms of settler society highlighted the differences s e at t l e i l l a h e e between seattle two peoples for many pioneers native ceremonies in town created lasting and deeply unsettling memories david kellogg recalled vividly the year for example when he heard that a klale tomaniwousa chinook jargon term that bostons typically translated as black magicwas going to take place along the waterfront arriv ing at a small house made of cedarbark mats and lumber from henry yeslers sawmill kellogg witnessed the initiation of a man known as bunty charley the pounding against the roof with poles and on the circle of stones around the fire was deafening kellogg recalled the proceedings soon moved outside with participants tossing charleys rigid body into the air and spraying it with mouthfuls of what appeared to be blood soon after charley began behaving like the bear power that had possessed him walking on all fours among the driftwood before shambling off toward the river the next morning he was seen in town wearing the badge of his new status a dusting of white duck down on his head and shoulders this was a traditional initiation into a secret society and its staging on the seattle waterfront was in keeping with the rituals logic such practices were not just religious rituals but social performances designed specifically to shock and impress observers and to cement the status of the secret societys members it certainly worked in kelloggs case holy smoke but it was a sight he wrote years later his shock still resonating decades later the ducks that provided bunty charleys dusting of down likely came from the duwamish rivers estuary which had been the source of other such emblems of status for centuries but like new kinds of spiritual power novel objects that could express social standingold blind charleys scarlet blanket for examplecould now also be procured in seattle indian people visited louisa boren denny to buy strips of silk cut from old dresses and she reminisced that the men in particular looked very fine with them around their waists knotted at the side meanwhile native women made use of that most cherished of pioneer symbols the patchwork quilt to highlight the status of their menfolk another denny kinswoman described how the indians quilts of blue and pink on white groundwork were made into shirts and how when dressed in a pair of blue trousers and with a bright red scarf tied around his waist and a gaudy red bandanna handkerchief around his head his feet encased in beadembroidered moccasins a siwash was a hy as tyee very fine chief indigenous women were also regular patrons at c c terrys store where they bought tin cups to beat into ornaments and it was not uncommon to see them dressed in hoopskirts and car rying parasols as commerce with places like san francisco grew in the s and s such consumer goods provided yet another rea son for indigenous people to visit along with dentaliumshell chokers and blankets woven from mountaingoat wool now hoopskirts and para sols purchased in town could reflect their owners prestige prestige and power could also be found in meetings of the mind between settler and native leaders in the s for example saneewa a snoqualmie headman from an important indigenous town at the foot of the cascades came every autumn with his family his ponies and his dogs to camp in arthur dennys pasture like seeathl saneewa saw denny arguably the most powerful man in town as a strategic ally but the relationship was mutually beneficial as the leader of a commu nity located at the western entrance to the lowest pass across the cen tral cascades which denny coveted for a wagon road saneewa provided crucial information about the route through the mountains a few years later denny would be among the surveyors to map what they called snoqualmie pass and as for saneewa many of his people and their descendants were able to remain in the valley where they had always lived rather than removing to reservations in part because of the rela tionships they built with settler headmen like denny here urban and indigenous ambitions coincided with trips to town reinforcing one native leaders territorial prerogatives while also facilitating the open ing of new routes for american settlement of the region hoopskirts and duck down ponies in pastures and wedding parties near sandspitseach of these things highlighted the ways in which settlers and indians encountered each other as indigenous men and women participated in town life during seattle first decades social status religious observance and political alliance were all part of the urban indigenous frontier on puget sound and offered means for native men and women to participate in urban society but throughout seat s e at t l e i l l a h e e tles village period each of these reasons for coming to town was over shadowed by another indians came to seattle or in some cases never left the place that became seattle for jobs as they contributed to the towns economy they would prove all too well that seattle indian his tory was nowhere close to ending indeed indigenous people saw seat tle as more than a settler community it was their community since they had been partners in its creation the question was what if any thing the bostons their civic leaders and their federal government were going to do about it i n the earlymorning hours of january the us navys sloop of war decatur opened fire on the illahee called seattle its targets were not the fifty or so white residents huddling in a tiny blockhouse at the corner of front and cherry rather the decatur was gunning for the estimated one thousand hostiles in the woods behind town they had come from indigenous communities in south ern puget sound and the far side of the cascade mountains to sack seat tle traveling down the old trail from lake washington to little crossingover place and taking up positions beyond the cleared yards at the edge of town they had already burned many outlying homesteads and now seemed about to raze what little existed of central puget sounds urban potential throughout the day settlers and marines exchanged fire with the attackers and by ten oclock that evening the enemy had retreated back to lake washington no bodies were ever found but some settlers estimated that as many as two hundred native warriors had died among the settlers one man and a teenage boy had been killed in less than twentyfour hours the battle of seattle was over enshrined in local mythology as the urtravail of early seattlea vio lent inverse of the chief seattle speechthe battle of seattle is like countless other events held to have occurred in what historian patricia nelson limerick has called the empire of innocence in which blame less white pioneers earn honor and success by surviving threats from nature indians or a corrupt government but what on its surface might seem like a showdown between savagery and urbanity was in reality a much messier affair illustrated by a map of the conflict drawn by the decaturs colonel george s phelps it shows a handful of streets and landmarks such as the blockhouse and the hotel belonging to mary ann mother damnable conklin above and to the right are the hills and woods thronged with indians but at the edges of the little town we also see two clusters of crosshatchingsalmost like plains tipis representing indian encampments on the slope above henry yeslers mill sits curleys camp and the other named tecumsehs camp stands across a dirt street from mother damnables distinguished from the native attackers these were indigenous people who had come to seattle but not to destroy it many of them had come to build it let there be no mistake without the labor of indians seattle would have been stillborn as lumbermen and laundresses hunters and haulers indigenous men and women made the city possible but at the same time their presence also brought the needs of an embryonic town into conflict with the larger aims of federal policies designed to segre gate and manage native communities civic leaders challenged the remote federal government and created a local indian policy based on the needs of urban communities like seattle and predicated upon a weak federal presence in the region not everyone felt that siwashes belonged in town though and a series of legal restrictions placed on indigenous people reflected settlers deep ambivalence about the place of indians in urban life as at alki point that first winter the presence and persistence of indians simultaneously facilitated and challenged seattle urban ambitions seattle indigenous workers included the men employed at henry yeslers sawmill the primary engine of commercial development for the first two decades of the towns existence in the early s nearly every white man in town worked in the mill but its output of some eight thousand board feet of lumber on a good day required the addi tional labor of native men edith redfield an early settler described sawmills like yeslers as little kingdoms a law unto themselves here white men indians chinamen and kanakas indigenous hawaiians worked side by side and boarded at the companys cookhouse indi ans and settlers may have worked and boarded together but natives also had particular contributions to make john m swan recalled how s e at t l e i l l a h e e indigenous men seasoned by regular bathing in the sound were well suited for rafting lumber out to arriving ships remembering the load ing of the orbit for the san francisco market for example swan recalled that several of us that were looking at them were shivering with the cold indian mill workers were especially crucial during the fraser river gold rush when in the words of settler william ballou workmen could not be hired for love nor money on puget sound as settlers hied off to the diggings and as indians carted sawdust away from yeslers mill they dumped it along the shoreline filling the lagoon of little cross ingover place and destroying the flounder fishery for which it had been known indigenous labor then obliterated an indigenous place mill work was only part of the contribution indians made to seat tles livelihood with supplies hard to find or outrageously priced set tlers depended on native subsistence networks to survive j thomas turner told historian hubert howe bancroft a quarter century later that whites in early seattle awaited upon the ebb and flow of the tides for their principal food we were largely dependent upon the native inhab itants for our potatoes and food products of forest and sound jane fenton kelly the daughter of a duwamish valley family recalled that native people made domestic life possible among the marshes and dense timber mother would send us out to watch for a canoe and we would hail them and give them a written order to the grocery man he would fill it and they would bring it out to us they charged twentyfive cents or twobits as they called it for each article they brought large or small i can remember after we were on the homestead onehalf mile up the hill an old indian by the name of jake carried a fivegallon keg of new orleans molasses to us and charged us but twentyfive cents in this way the duck nets and salmondrying frames of seattle indige nous geography fed its immigrant population the arrangement benefited indians as well hunters who brought mallards and other water fowl to white families were typically paid a quarter dollar for each bird these coins along with pelts of bears and other animals often changed hands on whiskey boats that plied the sound with cargoes of flour tobacco beads and liquor indigenous work went beyond mill labor and subsistence provision indians participated in almost every aspect of the seattle economy suc cessful or otherwise they packed hundreds of barrels of salmon for david doc maynard in the fall of a venture abandoned after the fish spoiled before arriving in san francisco they used traditional meth ods to render dogfish oil the primary lubricant for sawmill equipment in puget sound until the s native men cleared land and helped build homes on the slopes above elliott bay and native women did the washing within those homes indians paddled the canoe that carried the us mail and shorelinehugging siwash buggies as canoes were sometimes called were often the only way to travel from one place to another and of course there were the women celebrated by the ditty seattle illahee we can now only imagine the mix of limited oppor tunities and male coercion that led those women and girls from british columbia or elsewhere to the illahee but their contributions to the economy and reputation of seattle easily rivaled those of yeslers mill employees with the exceptions of banking americanstyle med icine and a handful of other settlerdominated vocations indians made seattle work in the s and their efforts helped settlers distinguish good indians from bad walter graham whose lake washington farm had burned during the battle of seattle nonetheless recalled that the indians he knew were good workers and that one had worked for him for three years but if settlers and indians forged everyday relationships through work tensions between indigenous people and the newcomers could also flare into violence well before the attack on the town in january violence between indians and whites had been a regular and deeply distressing occurrence one such case was that of an indian called mesatchie wicked in chinook jargon jim who killed his native wife near seattle in as punishment luther collins and several other settlers lynched jim on front street that lynching pre cipitated the slaying of a white man named mccormick near lake union in return two more native men were hanged in town such s e at t l e i l l a h e e spirals of violence took place when indigenous notions of justice which often mandated retaliation coincided with a powerful strain of vigi lantism in settler society that same year preachers wife catherine blaine recorded a similar cycle of killings that took the lives of two white men and as many as a dozen indian men inspiring settlers to organ ize a militia to take care of the problem natives had cooler heads not prevailed the militias offensive against indigenous people would have taken place not out in the woods or on a river somewhere but right in the heart of town where the indians in question were staying we feel considerably alarmed for ourselves the consistently timor ous mrs blaine wrote and her anxiety reflected that of many of her neighbors boston and native alike compared with the attempts at understanding that had taken place at alki point only a few years earlier these events illustrate just how dry the tinder was as more settlers moved in on indigenous lands near seattle and in fact many settlers did connect white emigration to vio lence if only to blame each other recalling the mesatchie jim case for example mill owner henry yesler described the effects of lower class emigrants on indianwhite relations noting that whenever there was trouble it was the fault of some worthless white man in what would become one of the most important patterns of conflict in seattle in the coming decades yesler identified class as a key element of race relations tensions between the law and order crowd repre sented by yesler arthur denny and other civic leaders and the worth less less orderly elements of urban society would shape life in seattle for years to come while yesler blamed interracial violence on the wrong kind of emigrants many indigenous people knew that lowclass set tlers were only part of the problem and so within just a few short years of seattle founding both set tlers and natives were calling for a new sort of order that new order came in the form of treaties designed to mitigate interracial violence by creating new boundaries between white and indian communities and settlingpun intendedthe question of indigenous title to the land much of the runup to the signings took place in urban outposts seat tle was the site of one such proceeding on january when isaac ingalls stevens the new territorial governor and indian superintend ent introduced himself and the treaty process to more than a thousand indians and some ten dozen settlers gathered in front of doc maynards office one year ten days and many speeches later seeathl and other headmen signed the treaty of point elliott in towns throughout puget sound settlers celebrated the treaty process one native elder in a particularly eloquent choice of words described seattle settlers reaction to the treaty as hooraying there was some cause for optimism among indians as well among other things the treaty ensured that indigenous people would have the right to camp hunt fish and harvest berries and roots at the usual and accus tomed stations and grounds but despite the promises of the treaty few indians were hooraying in fact significant factions in native com munities on salt water and beyond took offense at the treaty agreements and some did not hesitate to express their indignation in late for example a shaman named chaoosh visited david and louisa denny at their cabin on lake union after a government potlatch at tulalip north of seattle enraged at the agents offers of cheap needles and strips of blankets he warned them that whites were few in number and could be easily wiped out the condescending gifts paltry compared to what could be found in any towns shops only added to growing native out rage at the hubris of the bostons as tensions grew urban settlements beachheads of the american invasion of puget sound were obvious targets for the indigenous upris ing that seemed increasingly inevitable in response white officials began with what seemed like the most obvious first step removing indi ans from the towns indian agent michael t simmons however found that doing so was no simple task a month before the attack on seat tle after several attacks had already taken place elsewhere in the region simmons reported finding among seattle indigenous residents a strong determination not to cross over to their reservation i informed them that they must go over or they should receive nothing finally they obeyed my wishes and those of the head chief removal however could not only not prevent war but might actually lead to it henry yesler and several other seattleites for example warned that forc s e at t l e i l l a h e e ing indians onto the reservations was to all appearance tantamount to a declaration of war against them but many did not leave and in fact when the battle of seattle finally came it was indians who saved the day and the settlement on the eve of the conflict several hundred native people remained in and imme diately around the town including curley who had close connections both with henry yesler and with leschay leschi a nisqually militant who was allegedly organizing the attack curley met with leschay to call for peace but the warrior would not be swayed and so along with several other duwamish people and a number of white men who lived with indian women curley brought warning of the attack to the set tlers giving them just enough time to make haste to the tiny blockhouse connections between settlers and native people forged through every day life had saved seattle leschay would be hanged in for the murder of an american soldier a highly controversial punishment that divided settler opinion and ultimately resulted in leschays unofficial exoneration in despite the role that friendlies had played in mitigating the attack by hostiles on seattle once the smoke had cleared settler leaders quickly labeled all indians potentially dangerous and renewed their efforts to get indian people out of town for settlers unfamiliar with the complicated alliances and enmities that linked indigenous communi ties in puget sound segregation seemed the way to proceed especially with territorial newspapers warning that the savage warwhoop as it were is at the doors of every town and settlement within our borders but it was as difficult a task now as before the attack in july for example henry yesler now indian agent for the seattle area reported to governor stevens that a number of native people were fishing clam ming and harvesting berries at salmon bay yesler also wrote of two indian families who were still in the offlimits area of lake washington because one of their men mortally wounded by a faulty musket wanted to die and be buried on his illahee meanwhile george paige another indian agent complained that doc maynard had been treat ing native people like seeathls churchgoing sister sally and filling pre scriptions for them without first applying to paige for authorization their faith in traditional medicine shaken by epidemics some indige nous people saw visiting american doctors as a way to stay alive that is if they could get past duwamish valley settler luther collins who shot at seattlebound indians so often that it merited a letter of com plaint from one naval commander to governor stevens work remained the primary reason native people stayed in town after the attack and paige complained about this issue more than any other his threats to withhold government rations from indians living in town fell flat as they were mostly in the employ of whites consequently etc do not require feeding the source of the problem paige wrote was the intermedling businessmen who needed workers doc maynard was particularly guilty of having tampered with the agents charges this was ironic considering that maynard had complained about the very same issue only two months earlier when he briefly served as an indian agent while overseeing the relocation of seattle indigenous residents to remote west point in the late summer of maynard was confronted by henry yesler who wanted a portion of them to work for him it would cause him much trouble to go to the said encamp ment after them enlisting the support of arthur denny and other town leaders yesler convinced many of the indians to stay put and encour aged others to come in from the lake washington backcountry those who did follow maynards orders referred to by yesler and arthur denny as fools struggled through a series of brutal winter storms on the exposed and isolated spit the reservations were no better in novem ber an army captain at the muckleshoot agency in the cascade foothills wrote to his superiors on behalf of duwamish headman william that on the reservation they were furnished with a little flour daily by the indian agent page sic that they could get no clams there and the consequence was that many died of hunger and unless a num ber had gone to their old ground to procure salmon they should all have died on the reservation the point had been made life in town was better for indians just as indians in seattle were often better for the town by the end of it was clear that agents efforts to vacate indige nous settlements in and around seattle had not worked four separate s e at t l e i l l a h e e bands of native people remained in the seattle vicinity at the end of the year one small group of thirty or so under the leadership of a man known to settlers as cultus worthless charley was camping just north of town along the beach and more than a hundred remained directly across the bay at herrings house meanwhile curleys band of forty had settled in behind mother damnables in the heart of town and even native people who had gone to the reservations would return if only seasonally by midsummer of some three hundred indi ans were camped at the mouth of the duwamish river opposite seat tle likely at an ancient settlement and stockade called littlebitstraight point by not moving native people continued both to play a central role in seattle fledgling economy and to vex many of their nonindian neigh bors and the tensions between these two facts were expressed in a series of policies enacted in seattle during the s the first came in when seattle officially incorporated among the first ordinances passed was one decreeing that no indian or indians shall be permitted to reside or locate their residences on any street highway lane or alley or any vacant lot in the town of seattle but it also demanded that all per sons having in their employ any indian or indians within the corpo rate limits of said town shall provide lodgments or suitable residences for the said indians during the time of said employment on or imme diately attached to their own places of residence signed by charles terry ordinance no tried to codify a middle road between segrega tion and integration set alongside ordinances dealing with taxes side walks and magistrate fees the removal of indians ordinancewhich was really only about the removal of certain kinds of indians and the retention of othershighlighted just how central indians were to urban life on puget sound a second ambivalent document appeared a year later in in the form of a petition protesting a proposed reservation for duwamish indians along the black river south of seattle the inside place that gave the duwamish their name citing that the sixteen native families living there had been justly and kindly protected by the settlers the signatoriesvirtually every white man in king countyargued that a reservation would be an injury to the quiet and flourishing settlements along the black and duwamish rivers moreover it would be unnecessary to the aborigines and injurious to your constituents indigenous people working in town or living along the river were one thing for arthur and david denny henry yesler doc maynard and the other petitioners the imposition of a reservation close to seattle was quite another the settlers preferred their own system of manag ing indianwhite relations and so the proposed reservation was never established an outcome that would have significant consequences for duwamish legal status decades later the absence of a federal government capable of consistently enforc ing its own indian policies along with the necessity of indian labor meant that the people of seattleettler and indigenous alikehad to craft their own strategies for dealing with each other in the first years of the towns existence men like george paige tried to enforce reser vation policy while others like henry yesler actively thwarted it and still others like doc maynard seemed to change strategy depending on their circumstances meanwhile some indigenous people like seeathl went along with the treaties and left seattle while others like his sis ter sally insisted on continuing to come to town and still others such as leschay were driven by the american governments proposals to try to burn the settlers urban outpost to the ground in later years it would be this last indigenous strategy that would most commonly be used to explain why seattle seemed to stall in the years after the indian war arthur denny for example painted a bleak picture of the battle of seattle longterm effects noting that those who remained were so discouraged and so much in dread of another outbreak that they were unwilling to return to their homes in the coun try as a consequence it was years before we recovered our lost ground to any great extent certainly burned homesteads on the out skirts of town had frightened some settlers away but other forcesthe fraser river gold rush an economic depression the civil war and the lack of a railroaddid more to retard seattle growth during the s and s than the brief indigenous uprising and in fact much of the growth that did take place during those lean years was thanks to s e at t l e i l l a h e e indian labor in the form of logs shipped fish caught laundry washed and mail delivered native people had kept seattle from becoming yet another failed urban vision but even as the woods thronged with indi ans faded into clearcuts and memories indigenous people remained a threat to many bostons visions of urban destinyif not from out side seattle then from within it s eattle made its television debut during the vietnam war when here come the brides first aired on september with its theme song claiming the bluest skies youve ever seen are in seattle brides fictionalized one of seattle most beloved storiesthe importation of dozens of white women to seattle during and just after the civil warfor a national audience it was inspired by the story of asa shinn mercer twentyfive years old and the newly elected president of the territorial university of all his accomplishments mercer is most remembered as the entrepreneur who brought eleven unmarried women to the men of seattle in mostly unitarians from the industrial town of lowell massachusetts the women who would come to be known as mercer girls either mar ried white bachelors or became schoolteachers lauded for his effort mercer brought a second installment of thirtyfour girls in their story fraught with just the right mix of adventure and romance has been part of seattle placestory ever since the s television version was a balm against the growing horror of televised war in south east asia and in the s the real mercer girls were a balm as well not against the horrors of that decades own terrible war but against something that seemed more immediately threatening to many settlers the mixedrace world of seattle illahee when he went to the cities of the east seeking young women asa mercer went with a blessing in the form of a letter of recommendation from william pickering washington territorial governor both mercer and pickering saw this as a missionary enterprise in a circular dis tributed ahead of his visits mercer cautioned that we only wish a class of emigrants who will improve the religion morals and tone of soci ety in the territory mercer and by proxy certain elements of seat tle society were not interested in recruiting the easts urban rabble rather they wanted upstanding young women who could serve as social housekeepers transferring the civilizing institutions of marriage and education to the savage west as women signed on the travails ahead worried many of their families some wrote letters describing the ignor ance coarseness and immorality of seattle and claiming that wash ington territory was the last place in the world for women in a sense they were right seattle was a far cry from lowell or new york when those first eleven women disembarked from the sloop kidder on may they joined an ongoing struggle to establish urban order and not surprisingly in seattle illahee indigenous people were at the center of the debate what was at stake at least in the minds of some seattleites was the towns very survival as he traveled through new england and new york mercer described the challenges american civilization faced in the northwest he was particularly concerned about relations between white men and indian women which purportedly threatened the moral tone of a place where according to one settler it required a combination of all the towns to muster enough white women to make up three of four sets at a dance with those demographics the companionship of native women like the labor of native people more generally was part of everyday life in seattle and had been since the towns beginning the story of early seat tle is the story of intimate encounters indian jennie a niece of seeathl married african american settler john garrison according to the indian custom in the s around the time that matthew bridges married his native wife mary who had been born at little crossingover place rebecca fitzhenry was born in town to a white father and duwamish mother in six years later the duwamish woman kalaeetsa gave birth to her son charles whose father was settler michael kelly mill owner henry yesler recalled how many unmarried white men work ing in local sawmills had native women as companions and yesler him self had fathered a child named julia with the fifteenyearold daughter of curley despite the fact that his wife sarah was still alive and well and living in ohio through these new relations a whole generation of mixedrace children called seattle their illahee by the s s e at t l e i l l a h e e for asa mercer and others this was a dire problem in need of fixing ministers wife catherine blaine wrote home in for example about the doomed marriage of a settler named joe foster to betsy the grand daughter of seeathl infamous for being unkind to his wife fosters behavior eventually led betsy to hang herself in their small house in town her indian relatives demanded the body for burial while foster pleaded with settlers to allow her to be interred in the town cemetery they acquiesced but blaines husband refused to officiate at the funeral which was attended only by a few squaw men and their native com panions now what a situation he is in catherine blaine penned to her kin back east with his little halfbreed child and despised by whites and hated by the indians he is i believe the son of a minister and well brought up blaines portrayal of the foster familys tragedy is telling while clearly identifying fosters abuse as the proximal cause of betsys suicide it also hinted at a deeper problem in the minds of many seattleites on an urban frontier with few white women settler men could be tempted into liaisons with indigenous women and even a ministers son could be dragged down into the chaos that misce genation brought in another letter blaine bemoaned the degradation men bring on themselves in seattle through their relationships with native women who were but little better than hogs in human shape the children of such unions were a problem as well in the eyes of some bostons settler and historian charles prosch condemned mixedrace couples for giving birth to a class of vagabonds who promised to become the most vicious and troublesome element in the population the situation seemed to threaten the whole region according to mis sionary charles huntington race mixing cast a pall of moral dark ness over puget sound against which the mercer girls shone as beacons of light asa mercers importation of white women was just one means of rectifying the problem the law was another in the territorial leg islature had passed the color act which voided solemnized marriages between whites and indians in washington state three years later that law was amended to nullify all future interracial marriages as well and in the legislature would enact a new marriage act denying even commonlaw legitimacy to indigenouswhite relationships meanwhile superintendent of indian affairs w w miller published an editorial in the washington standard in calling for an end to the degrad ing practice of open prostitution and concubinage between settlers and indians which was so utterly subversive of good order reveal ing that there were also economic motives behind such a call for order the legitimacy act barred mixedrace children from inheriting their fathers estate if children existed from a previous marriage to a white woman unless white control of land and political power was pro tected by legislative means many proponents of miscegenation laws feared that thousands of acres would be handed down to a generation of mongrels and that the halfbreed vote would prove an embar rassment to ambitions toward statehood during his tenure in the ter ritorial legislature for example arthur denny himself would advocate tirelessly against giving mixedheritage people the vote for all their scope and number though the laws were often difficult to enforce his torian charles prosch complained that during the s and s it was difficult to find jurors and attorneys who did not have indian fam ily members and who were not therefore in sympathy with the delin quents just as the presence of indians thwarted some settlers urban visions everyday life in seattle illahee resisted the civilizing efforts of racist laws as moralizers fretted and lawmakers legislated life went on in seat tle illahee including at the namesake illahee itself opened in by john pinnell who had previously run brothels on san franciscos bar bary coast the illahee appeared the same year that superintendent millers miscegenation editorial appeared in the local press it was one of the largest buildings in seattle with a dance floor a long bar and a series of private rooms described in the census as hurdy gurdies the indian women employed there few if any of them from local tribal communities were also called sawdust women after the illahees location on the fill that had obliterated little crossingover place and its lagoon one typically pious memoir described bawdy houses and squaw brothels resounding with the the frantic cries of those whose sin had brought them to the verge of madness and despair sug s e at t l e i l l a h e e gesting that such institutions were well known even to those who would never consider darkening their doors on the streets and alleys south of mill street the mad houses another nickname for establishments like the illahee saloons and gambling parlors of seattle were known collectively as the lava beds a name with both infernal and libidinal connotations in seattle new placestory the sawdust women were the antitheses to the mercer girls and the mad houses stood in opposition to the orderly world north of mill street even the landscape reflected the difference prim houses among cleared woods on the hills versus shanties on the sopping tideflats at the same time the lava beds fueled the urban economy and despite all their moral outrage critics of the illahee lived in a town whose growth was driven by the engines of moral darkness asa mercer john pin nell and their women represented a kind of urban symbiosis after all it was not far from one side of mill street to the other never mind symbiosis though to the enforcers of moral authority in seattle the lava beds and the people who frequented them were threats to urban order for newspaper editors christian religious lead ers and others the presence of indians in seattle seemed to threaten not just the towns moral fiber but its very existence native people and the settlers who sided with themfor this struggle was very definitely perceived as having two sideswere portrayed as having the potential to quite literally destroy seattle two vectors of destruction almost apoc alyptic in their scope were of particular concern disease and fire in the minds of many influential seattleites both contagion and conflagra tion had their originsand scapegoatsin the towns mad houses and sawdust women long after the battle of seattle it seemed that indige nous people could still sack the place the earliest extant text printed in seattle dating from is a hand bill warning of an impending visitation by the dread smallpox which remained a potent reality in puget sound a century after its first terri ble appearance this was especially true in the filthy congested cities americans and canadians had built in the early s for example another wave of comes out all over had traveled from town to town arriving in seattle from san francisco via victoria british columbia as before indigenous communities bore the brunt of the microbes which killed hundreds if not thousands of indians in alone native people were at a loss as to how to stop it settler joseph crow for exam ple recalled the unsuccessful efforts of a native doctor to heal patients in a house at front and king streets on the lava beds during an out break in after which the doctor his skills now seen as useless disappeared but if indians were the primary victims of epidemics they were also the primary scapegoats between the lines of the handbill warn ing of disease lay powerful ideas about race sex and urban destiny in january for instance two native women died of smallpox in seattle what to us seems like a small outbreak inspired the seattle daily intelligencer to decry a much more pressing issue the traffic in miserable prostitutes by men like the vile wretch who had brought the two women from victoria and so when a native woman died of smallpox in a building south of mill street and another was found to be infected the press placed the blame squarely on the residents of the lava beds and their supposed moral failings it is not generally deemed advisable to mention the presence of this loath some disease in a city but we believe that to be an injustice to the public who should be seasonably apprised of contagion in any quarter and thus be enabled to guard against it aside from this we have another reason for alluding to the subject and that is to call immediate attention to the neces sity of our city authorities taking prompt steps to provide for the care of other cases which must occur from exposure to this and to adopt some stringent regulations relative to allowing any indians from british columbia and else where to be landed at this port or to visit or reside in this city as yet noth ing has been done in the way of preventing these filthy animals from visiting our city at will and bringing what may become a pestilence in our midst adding beastly squaws and filthy animals to a racist lexicon already inhabited by sawdust women and squaw men the editorial also posed a central question about urban progress were seattle legal and med ical establishments mature enough to deal with this crisis law enforce ment were still in its infancy and bostons still regularly died during s e at t l e i l l a h e e epidemics those facts combined with stillfresh memories of vast mor tality among the indians put very real fear in the hearts of settlers if ecological imperialismthe introduction of new species like smallpox to new worlds like salt waterhad made seattle founding possible the fear now was that it could unmake it as well in response to this new outbreak the city council ordered the mayor to pass laws preventing the spread of contagion to other seattleites if the official urban powers could not deal with the problem the daily intelligencer warned other forces might be brought to bear concerned citizens the paper suggested might regardless of our authorities so called take the matter in their own hands and adopt that vigorous course in the premises which is needed the heated rhetoric of the daily intel ligencer reflected the near hysteria that swept seattle during smallpox visitations in march for example some evil disposed person raised the standard of contagion a yellow flag in the window of a ten ement on mill street the paper described what happened next sev eral timid persons plunged off the sidewalk into the mud and shied away like young fillies in their first hurdle even a false alarm as this turned out to be could disrupt town life meanwhile real outbreaks continued in may mayor gideon weed a physician by training received a report of smallpox at salmon bay he went to investigate and discovered that one native woman had already died her relatives had buried her burned her clothing and bed ding and then quit the locality but weed located them the next day along the duwamish and had them placed under armed guard in a pest house on the ridge between seattle and lake washington their fate is lost to history but the incident was a great boost to the reputation of mayor weed who was lauded in the press as having done much more than could even have been asked or expected of him in that official capac ity it also inspired a new policy during smallpox outbreaks the police would prevent all indians from entering seattle so far as is practica ble but quarantines and exclusion did not prevent native communi ties from carrying more than their share of smallpoxs burden in the twelve months leading up to july for example there were eight een cases of the disease in seattle twelve white and six indian nine of the whites recovered while only one indian did more indigenous people living in and around seattle died in the next twelve months the encamp ment at smiths cove was hit particularly badly settlers discovered a number of indian bodies there buried in shallow graves with their broken guns not long after the remains of a man identified as the son of old moses were found jammed in a trunk north of town spurring another round of vaccinations among settlers who may have fooled around the tainted spot although smallpox was heading into decline as a major cause of mortality among both indians and settlers it remained on many bostons minds in the late s as one of the gravest dangers presented by indigenous people in the urban landscape smallpox was one danger fire was another in the nineteenth cen tury fire was perhaps the ultimate urban fear again and again cities throughout the industrializing world had experienced devastating fires that often changed the course of their history in profound ways in seat tle illahee fears of fire combined with anxieties about indians to spawn a second apocalyptic discourse in short many settlersand in par ticular those in charge of the newspaperswere convinced that native people were going to burn the town down one editorial for exam ple described the lava beds as a tinder box all primed and charged as it were and ready to explode without a moments warning in a whole sale conflagration after a narrow escape in september the daily intel ligencer posited that in time of peace it is best to prepare for war and called for the building of water tanks and the hiring of night watch men to patrol the lava beds and indian camps but for some the best way to deal with the fire danger was simply to get rid of the native encampments on the flats near main street not only were their inhab itants an element too indecent to be tolerated within the city limits said one editorial but their bonfires threatened the whole business portion of town there is also an old siwash shanty situated further down the reef and near the old pinnell house the article continued which should be razed to the ground and occupants driven off to the reservation where they belong the author then demanded that the chief of police take responsibility for keeping indians out of the city if he did not the result was sure to be catastrophic once again the s e at t l e i l l a h e e danger was not just material it was also moral never mind that other native people lived in town as family members and employees it was these threats who warranted the most public attention and who became an integral part of the young city new placestory in the end neither of the fires that swept seattleone in and the great fire of had anything to do with indians the first started in a middleclass hotel and the second which destroyed most of the business district began in a cabinetmakers shop other fires meanwhile targeted indian people on the night of may for example someone burned down the illahee the daily intelligencer cel ebrated the blaze which swept off a fusty obstruction to progressive improvements in that quarter citizens and firemen stood about watch ing the fire one settler recalled noting that not a pint of water was thrown upon the fire nor an effort made to save any part or article throughout puget sound laws and torches became weapons in the bat tle between two urban orders one symbolized by the mercer girls and the other by the lava beds in the decades to come two competing urban visionsan open town that actively encouraged its redlight district and a closed town with zero tolerance for viceremained at the core of seattle politics what would be forgotten in the future though was that such debates had their roots in earlier conflicts over the role of native people in town life and over who belonged in this new place called seattle s ometime in the s a chinese man named ling fu was brought before judge cornelius hanford in seattle courthouse accused of not having the proper citizenship papers facing deportation ling fu argued that he did not need to carry papers he had been born on puget sound to test him judge hanford quickly shifted his inquiry into chinook jargon which had become nearly as common as whulshootseed or english in puget sound coun try ikta mika nem consee cole mika what is your name how old are you he demanded of ling who in turn replied nika nem ling fu pe nika mox tahtlum pee quinum cole my name is ling fu and i am twentyfive years old clearly surprised the judge responded you are an american sure and you can stay here he then turned to the bailiff and decreed ling fu is dismissed ling fus brief trial symbolizes the ways in which settlersboston chinese and othershad been transformed by their life in seattle illa hee accounts of seattle village period are full of settlers speaking chinook jargon and sometimes even whulshootseed of white men and women learning indigenous subsistence practices from their native neighbors and employees and of people from places like illinois and ireland gloucester and guangzhou learning to accommodate indians insistence on participation in urban life nearly thirty years after seat tles founding native people were still in town and their participation in urban life had changed the bostons as well the mad house known as the illahee might have been destroyed but the larger seattle illahee in which indigenous lives were woven into the urban fabric remained even as seattle stood perched on the brink of an urban revolution s e at t l e i l l a h e e the returning hosts t he seattle spirit the story of a city birth in pioneer stalwartness could take its adherents in strange new directions on the centennial of the landing at alki it could lead them into the cold war the founders day celebrations of were like those in the past full of pomp and pageantry some celebrants attended performances of the landing of the calico pioneers followed by baton twirling and a god bless america singalong at the alki field house while more studious participants visited city hall to view the city original charter and various other musty old files and like other founders days the centerpiece of the centennial was a reenactment of the denny partys landing where junior high school boys in badly dyed wigs played indian awaiting the arrival of grownups playing pio neer as the founders strode ashore mayor william devin smashed a bottle containing the commingled waters of seattle lakes and rivers against the alki monument the hiawatha sparklers did an indian dance and serial salute bombs closed the program the reenactment of the landing at alki was the heart of the centennial program but its headliner was general douglas macarthur thousands of seattleites went to the university of washington the next day to hear him extol the lessons of alki point he told his audience that seattle had been the full beneficiary of what the pioneering spirit has wrought upon this continent but warned that said spirit was still very much needed should the pioneering spirit cease to dominate the american character macarthur continued our national progress would end for a nations life is never static it must advance or it will recede invok ing longstanding anxieties about the loss of the frontier the man who so famously strode ashore in the philippines proposed an agenda for the nation to the early pioneer the pacific coast marked the end of his courageous westerly advanceto us it should mark but the beginning to him it delimited our western frontierto us that frontier has been moved beyond the pacific horizon broadcast on national television one of seattle first appearances in the mediummacarthurs speech linked the seattle spirit to the nations interests in the pacific the story of seattle birth in a wilderness with its own red menace could now resonate for a new generation and the seattle spirit always linked to the nations own placestory helped lead the nation for better or mostly for worse into new places around the world for all its historical rhetoric macarthurs speech had little to do with the past and much more to do with the future it was much like another centennial event the burying of a time capsule on alki beach the cap sules contents were not listed in the postintelligencer story announc ing its burial but the authors vision of the future was richly detailed seattleites might for example shoot over to alki point in their per sonal atomic cruisers to watch the opening of the time capsule on november well probably be wearing a spun air afternoon dress with radium buttons imagined journalist dorothy hart and nary a qualm about the weather before the days of atmospheric control we understand seattle women carried umbrellas here was seattle space age future full of technocratic optimism and personal affluence despite threats abroad here was a seattle that had escaped its past not to mention its ecology although surely tongue in cheek harts vision of twentyfirstcentury seattle reflected its time that period in the s when consensus pol itics consumer confidence and scientific progress augured a bright future for americans in the years to come however history would inter vene the consensus would crack as social unrest transformed public discourses on race inspired in part by the unjust ways in which post war affluence had been distributed the american indian womens service league and united indians of all tribes made that point beau tifully meanwhile harts atomic cruisers and radium dress buttons would come to seem like na√Øve paeans to a nuclear industry that only a few short decades after its inception was seen by many to be an eco t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s logical nightmare instead of a nuclearpowered climatecontrolled deracinated futuropolis seattle became a place where both multicul tural politics and environmental anxieties dominated much of postwar civic life most important to our story the legacy of seattle urban and native histories would come back to haunt the city in the postwar era as in the apocryphal chief seattle speech the white manand all the other new people here including urban indians from other placeswould never be alone but it was not the ghosts of seattle indigenous people that returned to the city it was their living descendants fueled by both the new activism shared by other urban indians and growing unease about the legacies of urban conquest the grandchildren and greatgrand children of the duwamish and shilsholes and lakes began to exert new influences over both urban environmental affairs and the civic story by the late twentieth century even if seattle continued to use indian imagery to market itself on the global stage it could no longer easily do so without taking into account the city real native past it appeared that seeathls returning hosts had indeed come back to town in ways that macarthur and the hiawatha sparklers never could have imagined f rom elvis presley movies to reruns of the popular tele vision series frasier the space needle has replaced princess angeline and perhaps even her father as the symbol of seat tle rising hundreds of feet over where denny hill once stood before it was washed away by the regrades

received its second life magazine cover in may showing the futuristic monorail streaking along with the space needle rising in the background it was described as being out of this world and there was some truth to this for six months and ten million guests the fair had captured the ethos of the era in which ecological and technological constraintseven gravity itselfseemed a thing of the past but less than a decade later something had shifted seattle had become ecotopian in truth well before the publication of ernest callenbachs mediocre but wildly popular utopian novel ecotopia in which seattle portland and san francisco became the centers of a seces sionist nation organized around environmentalist principles seattle culture of nature was undergoing a radical transformation con fronted by the pollution attendant to rapid urban and suburban growth and fueled by a growing emphasis on health aesthetics and an out door lifestyle seattleites began in the late s to undertake massive campaigns to undo environmental damage in and around the city cleaning up lake washington protecting green spaces and enhanc ing salmon runs became major civic projects while seattle became a haven for environmentalist organizations that hoped to change policy throughout the region and beyond by the s these efforts had helped to shape an environmentalist ethic in seattle that if by no means mono lithic dramatically reoriented the city selfimage gone was the seat tle that prided itself on lumber mills and regrades and rail connections in its place was one of the few cities in the world that one moved to in order to get closer to nature now the space needle simply offered the best view of sound and mountains few things reflected this cultural shift more or had more implica tions for native people than the symbolic resuscitation of chief seat tle just as seattle the city was born again as an environmentally friendly metropolis in the s seeathl the symbolic indian was reborn as well more than the city patron saint he now became the city first envi ronmentalist this was not just a local phenomenon following the publication of an augmented version of the speech in which seeathl t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s anachronistically mourned the coming of the railroad and the passing of the buffalo the words attributed to the native leader became famous around the world particularly among european environmentalists pro gressive christians concerned with human rights and some native rights activists soon the city public image became closely linked to the ostensible environmental message of its namesake as well as to a growing concern for the predicament of indian peoples but the question remained who was seeathl now being asked to serve while many native peoples and in particular puget sound area tribes used the chief seattle speech as evidence of their claim to the lands in and around seattle for many nonindians the words of the longdead indigenous leader had a different purpose theologian and ecophilosopher thomas berry for example found the speech to be a profound insight into the enduring trauma being shaped in the psy chic depths of the white man referring particularly to the prophecy that settler society would never be alone and would be haunted by indian ghosts these voices are there in the wind in the unconscious depths of our minds berry continued these voices are there not primarily to indict us for our cruelties but to identify our distortions in our rela tions to the land and its inhabitants and also to guide us toward a mutu ally enhancing humanearth relationship for all their sympathy toward indigenous people berrys words were statements about his tory and about power the words attributed to seeathl were not about conflict but about healing and at their core they were most valuable not in how they could serve seeathls own people or in how they might bring to light the injustices of the past but in how they might assuage the environmental ills of modern american society as has so often been the case in seattle history stories that nonindians told about native people were in fact not about native people but about nonindians but beginning in the late s something new was happening whereas in the past whites and others had often been able to tell sto ries about indians and the city without taking into account actual native american people and their concerns new political legal and cultural developments brought indian people back into the center of urban life seattle ecotopian turn was accompanied by a parallel resurgence in native american activismnot just among the urban indians of the service league and united indians of all tribes but among local tribes as well these developments allowed the very real descendants of seeathl and their tribal compatriots to assert a new kind of influence over the city as new ideas about nature and progress came to dominate seattle civic consciousness local tribes achieved a new degree of control over their ancient territories as ecological stewards and protectors of cultural patrimony even if those territories had been changed irrevocably that local tribes would come to be seen as urban environmental stew ards seemed unlikely in the s when members of the muckleshoot tribe whose reservation was upstream from seattle and whose pop ulation included some descendants of the duwamish became scape goats for the depletion of salmon runs criminalization of indigenous subsistence practices begun decades earlier continued well into the postwar period in for example harold e miller director of the new regional environmental and planning entity known as metro characterized the gillnetting practiced by muckleshoots upstream from the city as anathema to urban environmental restoration miller claimed in the seattle times that all we have done in the duwamish is being offset by this fishing activity never mind urban development and the wholesale transformation of local rivers the disappearance of the fish was clearly the indians fault beginning in the late s however native people became increas ingly defiant about the statesponsored repression of treaty fishing rights and staged fishins throughout puget sound and even in and around seattle bringing salmon conservation and human rights to center stage in local national and international media one morning in the early s for example muckleshoot fishermen convened on the shore of lake washington with members of the american indian movement and with other northwest tribes makahs were prepared to die for our cause recalled gilbert king george and until the drums and songs of the protestors convinced the wellarmed fish and game wardens to back down violence seemed imminent the presence of the american indian movement the national indian youth council and other allies also spurred fishins on the tidal duwamish by then our group was t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s growing and growing and we outnumbered the state agents king george remembered whats one or two guys mean when they come down the river banks and we are about ornery old indian people standing up for what they firmly believed in the fishins brought together many strands of seattle native community one muckleshoot activist recalled that she already knew most of the american indian move ment people from her days on skid road and the american indian womens service league got involved as well publishing articles about fishing rights in indian center news so while urban indians and local tribes had very different histories in this place this place also brought them together in defense of native rights as a shared principle meanwhile many nonindian seattleites had come to support treaty fishing rights thanks in part to the savvy media techniques of indian activists by when george boldt us district court judge finally ruled in favor of the tribes in united states v washington ordering the state to allocate half the harvestable salmon to treaty tribes many seat tle residents with the noticeable exception of the city large commer cial fishing industry had in fact already become outspoken advocates of both tribal sovereignty and a new socially informed approach to con servation throughout the fish fights progressive churches civilrights organizations and other groups decried the arrests and intimidation faced by tribal members and played critical roles in garnering support for fishing rights by the s seattle had become a center of pro indian and proenvironment sentiment perhaps best symbolized in the formal apology for cultural genocide and religious oppression that was issued by seattlearea churches in these new urban attitudes toward nature and native peoples were often linked to each other through the increasingly iconic image of the salmon a connection that had lasting implications for tribal authority in the city in the years to come the muckleshoots and suquamish fed erally recognized tribes whose membership included many descendants of the indigenous people of seattle began to assert themselves as stew ards of seattle environment they focused their attentions in partic ular on fisheries empowered both by boldts ruling and by seattle growing urban environmental ethos in for example the tribes intervened against the proposed seacrest marina a million project that would have occupied feet of shoreline between duwamish head and the mouth of the duwamish tribal concerns over the impact on fisheries along with opposition from urban environmentalists led to the scrapping of the seacrest proposal despite opposition from devel opers rightwing ideologues and many commercial fishermen tribal efforts to manage urban nature earned positive reviews from environ mental organizations and the mainstream press when the muck leshoots created a tribal fishing reserve in elliott bay in for instance the seattle times referred to the tribe as a fine conservation example a total reversal of the scapegoating so common only twenty years ear lier in the fourteen years since the boldt decision tribes had exerted their authority over environmental issues just as those issues were com ing to dominate civic consciousness in the city named for an indige nous man now thought of as its first environmentalist native authority had returned but like other developments in seattle postwar indian history the path to tribal control over urban places had its ironies for example the treaty of point elliott was the legal basis for tribal fishing in the waters in and around seattle the treaty assured indians access to the usual and accustomed places and resources that their ancestors had man aged for millennia but those places had often been transformed beyond recognition by urban development as muckleshoot fishing nets tangled with pleasure boats in the lake washington ship canal in the s for instance they did so in a waterway that did not exist at the time of the treaty the same engineering marvels that had destroyed indigenous subsistence in and around seattle had also created a new and spectacular fishery that was neither usual nor accustomed simi larly tribes and their environmentalist allies won major concessions in a sixtyfiveacre marina development on the north shore of elliott bay concessions that included tribeoperated pens for up to one million farmed coho salmon if tribal concerns sprang out of historic connec tions with the indigenous landscape their modern manifestation some t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s times bore little relation to the indigenous geography of salmon finally despite tribal claims on the city environment and a strong envi ronmentalist ethic among many seattleites by the end of the twenti eth century the salmon were almost gone indeed some of them had been placed on the endangered species list for all the power local tribes had gained over urban nature the city environmental history had not been reversed and resentments over the new tribal authority contin ued to simmer when the muckleshoots legally killed two sea lions that had been devastating salmon runs at the ship canal locks the tribe received threats including one warning that an indian would be killed for every dead sea lion the hunt also brought the tribe into conflict with environmentalists the progressive animal welfare society and the humane society were among the hunts most outspoken critics indians as symbols of nature were one thing indians as reallife hunters in the city were quite another the muckleshoots and suquamish emerged from the fishins and other wranglings of the s and s as legally enfranchised stake holders in the urban environment as federally recognized tribes they asserted their treaty rights and sought in many cases successfully to become comanagers of significant elements of the urban environment by the end of the twentieth century the two tribes had become stew ards of seattle waterways and shorelines even if those places had been transformed almost beyond recognition while their ascendancy was related to a broader nationaleven internationalmovement toward tribal selfdetermination beginning in the s local forces includ ing urban ones had also helped to set the stage for this new develop ment their activism while rooted in their own reservation experiences was also influenced and supported by indian allies whose traditions of protest had grown out of the more radical multicultural urban work of groups like united indians of all tribes meanwhile their successes in the public eye if not necessarily the courtroom hinged to no small degree on the fact that the nonindian seattleites questioning the social and environmental legacies of their city growth seemed readier than ever before to acknowledge tribal peoples as having a stake in envi ronmental management but the suquamish and muckleshoots were not the only local indians to place new claims on seattle in the late twen tieth century t he boldt decision as united states v washington soon came to be known was a stunning victory for the people whose ancestors had settled the shores of salt water millennia ear lier it was also a victory for indigenous peoples around the world its basic premisethat indigenous peoples by definition have unique claims on their territorieshas become the basis for success ful legal arguments throughout the united states as well as in canada australia and new zealand at the same time it also set local tribes against each other creating legal conflicts over shared or overlapping traditional territories the duwamish tribe including descendants of the lakes and shilsholes had been involved in land claims cases throughout the twentieth century its members giving testimony along side relatives and allies from reservations at muckleshoot tulalip suquamish and elsewhere but in many ways the duwamish had always been different for one simple reason their territory included the pacific northwests largest city and the regions most valuable real estate arbiters of indian law rarely recognized that value after decades wait ing for settlement of their claims duwamish tribal members each received in for lands in what was now seattle but for the duwamish a greater offense was yet to come in five years after his decision in united states v washington judge boldt determined that the duwamish and four other puget sound native com munities no longer met all of the seven criteria required for inclusion on the list of tribes eligible for treaty fishing rights in the case of the duwamish the disqualifier was an apparent tenyear break in the tribes political leadership one of the seven criteria required showing con tinuous tribal organization from the signing of a treaty to the present the decade in question stretched from to the years imme diately after the completion of the lake washington ship canal and the destruction of the black river where many duwamish people had still been living the chaos of those years now had its consequences some six decades later the modernday duwamish officially ceased to t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s exist in the eyes of the federal government and thus were considered to have no legal claim over the city named for their ancestral leader never mind that government agents had included the duwamish dur ing discussions of proposed tribal termination policies of the s bureaucratic extinction is one thing actual disappearance is quite another so while the decision to extinguish duwamish treaty status might have been a massive blow to the tribes claims it also opened new doors in terms of public sentiment during the same years that the muckleshoots and suquamish were anglingliterallyfor control over the city environment the duwamish even without federal recog nition laid their own claims on seattle stripped of legal authority the duwamish capitalized on changes in what it meant to be urbanmost notably the ascent of environmentalism and multiculturalism in civic politics and new ideas about historyto assert a kind of cultural authority in doing so they would not only challenge their own alleged extinction but capsize the city very story of itself the duwamish river was a place utterly transformed by the year after united states v washington only a single curve of the indige nous estuary still existed near the place where seetoowathl and his wife had starved half a century earlier this backwater bend sheltered by a sliver of scrubby island was all that remained of the oncefecund inter face between river and salt water for some though even that was too much unproductive nature in the port of seattle proposed to dredge and fill it to make way for a new container ship terminal dur ing initial surveying an army corps of engineers archaeologist identi fied the riverbankthen sporting five dilapidated housesas a site of significance historical documents and shell middens suggested that the site had once been an indigenous town it appeared that the duwamish village of basketry hat had been rediscovered but in early the port made a mistake while demolishing the old houses a bulldozer operator obliterated most of the archaeological layers at the site almost immediately the local press blasted the port for destroying a crucial piece of seattle heritage business and maritime editors were less outraged one longed rather confusingly for the days when there were many more acres of clams here and digging for those clams was the only dig that man worried about in its own defense the port contended that it did not know the houses were on top of the archaeological site and since public corporations could not be sued it could not be held accountable anyway these excuses did little to satisfy those who saw the ports actions as the wanton destruction of civic patrimony then cecile maxwell stepped into the fray as the young chairwoman of the duwamish tribe maxwell was like many indian leaders in her generation including bernie whitebear unafraid of controversy and extremely media savvy her own activism however was also shaped by her familys connections to local places and by watching for exam ple her brother being arrested for fishing on the duwamish soon after the bulldozer had done its work in maxwell used her anger and expertise to begin telling a new kind of placestory with the help of other duwamish tribal members and allies in the local press maxwell connected what had happened at basketry hat to broader urban and native narratives in one interview for example she lamented that we have no culture left no history left thats because we have no land base linking the ports blunder to a longer history of dispossession meanwhile activist and journalist terry tafoya pointed out in the post intelligencer that europeans were in the dark ages when the longhouses of basketry hat were built and that perhaps a thousand years from now indians will discover the decaying remains of the space needle for their part the postintelligencers editorial staff noted that the pio neers who arrived at alki point were johnny and janiecomelatelies going on to ask who says that seattle was founded in and when the dig went public in with free tours the site was interpreted as a boon not only to the public but also to the duwamish people and presented a chance to learn about the way of life of the duwamish people whose past has almost been completely wiped out by a grow ing city here then was the overturning of seattle narrative like the treaty read at fort lawton or the fishins on lake washington these were new kinds of public placestories about seattle and about urban meaning and often seemed to arise directly out of the ground itself in for example construction crews disturbed cultural deposits t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s while building a new sewage treatment plant at west point builders immediately halted construction and allowed excavation to take place under tribal oversight and at a cost of one month and million post intelligencer arts writer solveig torvik noted that seattle residents and the tribes would be inestimably poorer if sites like west point were destroyed as at the lauded opening of daybreak star civic and indian goals appeared to merge but tensions remained in early while digging footings for the new seattle world trade center a port worker discovered a womans skull attached to a piling having learned from past mistakes the port stopped work and contacted the suquamish and muckleshoots but they neglected to notify the duwamish who learned of the discovery only through the media under the leadership of cecile maxwellactually now known as cecile hansenthe duwamish picketed the dig seattle promotes itself as a place of great cultural sen sitivity hansen told a seattle times reporter i am here to tell you this cultural sensitivity has not been measurably extended to seattle indigenous duwamish tribe and its people even though the nature of seattle relationship to its indigenous past had changed for some that change had not gone nearly far enough still the fact that the duwamish with no legal standing as a tribe were able to garner significant media attention and public sympathy spoke to the cultural authority they had acquired in seattle urban imag ination that attention and sympathy increased in the new millennium as the duwamish worked to have their federal recognition reinstated working with local archivists and historians they sutured together the alleged tenyear break in tribal organization using oral histories catho lic church records and genealogical research recognizing the disrup tions caused by environmental transformation the duwamish argued that what seemed like a break in organization was in fact simply a change from one generation of tribal leadership to another within a single identifiable duwamish community their argument must have been convincing on the last day of the clinton administration cecile hansen received a phone call from the bureau of indian affairs telling her that the duwamish had been recognized the victory was shortlived how ever only a few days later the new bureau of indian affairs adminis trator appointed by george w bush informed hansen that the deci sion had been reversed stunned hansen other members of the duwamish tribe and their allies vented their anger in the local press but the greatest opportunity to express their outrage was yet to come fifty years after macarthurs speech seattle was about to celebrate its th birthday the coverage of the duwamish recognition fracas which included frontpage stories in local papers as well as some international cover age dovetailed with the runup to the sesquicentennial of seattle found ing by november it was clear that it would no longer be possible to tell seattle story without the participation of native people and in particular without the duwamish and so when actors playing the denny party came ashore in a drenching rain at alki that november they were welcomed not only by hundreds of spectators as in past reenact ments but by cecile hansen and other representatives from the duwamish tribe after a series of speeches many of which noted the tribes recognition struggle city leaders unveiled two new plaques at the alki monument one commemorating the women of the group the other honoring the duwamish who had made survival at new yorkalki possible meanwhile at a luncheon attended by members of the denny bell boren terry and low families ruth moore the greatgranddaughter of john and lydia low told those gathered that we need to let the fed eral government know that those indians made the city possibleand i love them for it sesquicentennial events often emphasized either the positive inter actions between pioneers and native people in the first months of set tlement or the multicultural sentiments of the late twentieth and early twentyfirst centuries they left out much of what had happened in between the burning of the longhouses the attempts to keep indians out of town the fish fights in crafting a new multicultural placestory anniversary organizers had perhaps stilled the manichean heart of the seattle spirit but they had also whitewashed much of seattle real his tory on a handful of occasions however a more confrontational ver sion of seattle urban story rose to the surface as part of a local museum exhibit anne overacker rasmussen described the shame she had once t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s felt at being duwamish even in a city named for one of her duwamish ancestors at long last memories of no dogs or indians allowed were creeping into the mainstream urban narrative meanwhile at the pio neer family reunion historian david buerge who had helped craft the duwamish petition for recognition pointed out that if the duwamish had a nickel for everyone who said something should be done for them they could afford to buy back a considerable chunk of seattle he thus highlighted the difference between honoring the city indian past and addressing its indian present and at a sesquicentennial rotary lunch eon duwamish tribal member james rasmussen balked at reciting the speech attributed to seeathl the duwamish are staring down the maw of extinction while you talk of progress i wont do this he told them before abruptly walking off the stage and as the final event of the year long sesquicentennial duwamish tribal members welcomed canoes full of indian people from many tribes ashore at a new city park at the site of basketry hat asserting their status as guardians of their traditional homeland the sesquicentennial might have ended but the efforts of the duwamish to obtain federal recognition did not after a series of inquiries into criminal wrongdoing in the bureau of indian affairs dur ing both the clinton and the bush administrations the issue came to down to technicalities when a particular set of papers was signed and whether those papers were drafts or final copies finally in the spring of interior secretary gale norton reaffirmed the governments position against recognition despite a concerted campaign on the part of seattlearea religious organizations and other duwamish allies these included more than six dozen descendants of seattle pioneers who signed a petition calling for the creation of the duwamish reservation that their ancestors had petitioned against more than a century earlier meanwhile federally recognized tribes in the area had staked out a wide range of positions on duwamish recognition the suquamish across puget sound supported it the tulalip tribes to the north said they would not fight it having lost a similar battle with the snoqualmie tribe in the s and the muckleshoots announced plans to fight duwamish recognition should it ever be granted through an act of congress the only option left this would be the great irony of united states v wash ington in settling old disputes it had opened new legal political and cultural rifts in the city and beyond meanwhile the forces of urban dispossession that had rendered the duwamish invisible in the early twentieth century continued to have powerful effects in the twentyfirst the duwamish have continued their efforts to carve out a place in the city with the financial support of individual donors companies and local governments cecile hansen and her group purchased land on west marginal way just across the street from basketry hat with plans to build a longhouse and cultural center this longhouse wont just be for us hansen told a reporter the summer before the sesqui centennial it will be for everyone who lives in and visits seattle as with bernie whitebears peoples lodge and edgar heap of birds day night a large part of being indian in modern seattle involved showing yourself to nonindians on your own terms the duwamish longhouse once built would be a way for one indian community to tell its place stories to a larger community that finally appeared to be listening recog nition and a reservation however seem farther away than ever b ack in boosters ruled the day only aging pioneers and a few indian people saw fit to question seattle rise to met ropolitan primacy and their accounts of vanquished spirit pow ers and bucolic village life were not often heard among the shouts and bellows of the advocates of metropolis one of those cheechakos his name now lost to history scripted one of the thousands of promotional brochures that beckoned visitors to look around settle down and buy in he began with his own encounter with the city first impression as i found her so will i always think of seattle as young and eager life still the great unexplored living still the great adven ture with no old past to stop and worship no dead mens bones to reckon with no traditions chained to her ankles here then was the prevailing placestory of the modern era and not just in seattle that the past was irrelevant although it had been a great adventure that only the future lay ahead of the city and nation that all negative consequences of mod ern urban life would be outweighed by the benefits no old bones t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s not so just ask jan deeds and ron mandt three quarters of a cen tury after that anonymous promoter crowed about seattle freedom from the past laborers unearthed old bonestwo adults and a child to be exactwhile repairing the foundation of deeds and mandts home near alki point as work came to a halt and the coroner was called the home owners soon learned that this was not the first time indian graves had been disturbed here half a century before an earlier resident had expe rienced a little excitement when he found bones under the house in those days aside from meriting a bemused article in the seattle times such a discovery carried no consequences but for deeds and mandt who lived in a very different seattle at the beginning of the twentyfirst century and were trying to sell their house there were definite conse quences which they bore with great decency calls to the suquamish and muckleshoot tribes but not to the duwamish thousands of dol lars paid to privately hired archaeologists and buyers who withdrew their offer finally reburied in accordance with tribal wishes and the states indian graves and records act the family first laid to rest here long ago showed that there are in fact old bones to reckon with in seat tle boosters may still run the show but at least now they have to share the stage word has gotten around the past has consequences the central challenge of seattle native histories however has been to acknowledge those consequences the struggles of the duwamish tribe in the last quarter of the twentieth century typify the tensions inher ent in seattle native pasts on the one hand they show the lasting social and environmental consequences of the city urban development on the other hand the attention the duwamish received at the end of the century and especially around the time of the sesquicentennial shows the metaphorical place some native people have come to occupy in the urban imagination as environmental stewards as indictments of injustice and as indigenous hosts of civic history and so we return to the central problem of seattle native pasts the distance between the imagined indian in the city and the real experiences of indian people and the tensions between fantasy and reality symbolism and history ghosts and humanity all too often the tendency remains to talk about seattle indian imagery and seattle indian people as though they have little to do with each other during the sesquicentennial for example the vocal presence of the duwamish tribe was at times overshadowed by seattle symbolic indians especially in discussions of one of the thorniest urban concerns of recent years transportation seattle has some of the worst traffic in the nation and efforts to build mass transit systems have been hampered both by citizensponsored tax revolts and by infighting among transit organizations what is fas cinating about the transportation debates however is how often metaphorical indians have been part of them the winner of a seattle weekly poetry contest for example had seeathl cursing seattle with tim eyman the notorious spokesperson for several antitax initiatives arrrrrgh nixoney chuga roalhop eyman nonshaman hooog in facto we chinnok cho killa firebo an der baa baa healtee err an errer arrrrrgh cursed treatybreaching fiends may a smiling white devil eyman eviscerate your roads your emergency and health services and your quality of life and community for ever and ever meanwhile indian author sherman alexie penned a sarcastic column in the city other alternative weekly the stranger about the ancient monorail of the kickakickamish people which had been destroyed along with most of its builders by vengeful neighbors it was genocide alexie wrote noting that the current monorail was still haunted by the ghosts of the kickakickamish who would tear to pieces any expansion of the spaceage skytrains route then for a story a few months later about sports utility vehicles the weeklys front cover showed the statue of chief seattle sticking out of an electric cars sunroof over the tagline what would chief seattle drive like other indian images in seattle past these stories were not really about native people at all that is exactly the point even today indians in seattle are often more visible as metaphors than as people when for example an emcee quipped at the rotarys sesquicentennial luncheon that native canoes are mov ing smoothly through the black river scurves in a mock nineteenth century traffic bulletin he linked one of the seattle areas worst highway t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s interchanges with the empty riverbed nearbyas a joke no wonder james rasmussen whose duwamish ancestors had once lived on the black river had walked out debates over traffic and mass transit are closely related to the urban malaise experienced by many seattleites during the s when the phenomenal wealth and growth of the dotcom boom seemed to threaten the city identity among the most vocal of those concerned was writer fred moody who had spent years chronicling the hightech industrys effects on the region he lamented the loss of a more work ingclass slowerpaced seattle a place his intellectual forebear the iras cible newspaperman emmett watson had dubbed lesser seattle back in the s moodys lament drew from the native past the better the city material prospects the worse its psychological pros pects i sat up late one night and regarded the history of seattle as a history of diminishment boom by boom i remembered reading how the tribes finally were forcibly put on a boat and sent out into the sound now i saw their expulsion as equal parts exile and deliverance they were our first lesser seattleites fully aware that a material boom would bring a spiritual bust to their homeland they served by their very existence to mock the pretensions of newcomers intent on bringing civilization and wealth to the northwests paradise in moodys estimation the seattle of microsoft starbucks and ama zoncom had gone overboard newyorkprettysoon had grown into morethannewyorkrightnow he complained continuing that seattleites like him and his downwardly mobile friends were practi cally the next best thing to native americans arguing that the defining characteristic of a lesser seattleiteand of lesser seattle itselfwas the forswearing of ambition moody realized that the ques tion what kind of city is seattle becoming was also what the hell am i turning into the interesting thing was how crucial indians were to the answer on the other side of the debate over seattle soul robert ferrigno a contributor to microsofts online slate magazine pointed out that seat tles problems in fact stemmed from the sloth and poor economic poli cies of its other tenants indians scandinavians and hippies the indigenous tradition of the potlatch ferrigno claimed had prevented research and development and the potlatchs supposed values no investments no competition no ego no progress had prevented northwest indians and their slowgrowth descendants from reaping the rewards of urban achievement a similar story about the socalled seat tle freeze the idea that people in the city are superficially friendly but distant and hard to get to know meanwhile referred back to emmett watsons tongueincheek claim that seattle was indian for stay away from here according to these observers of local culture both the best and worst things about seattleits disappearing authenticity on the one hand and its stubborn resistance to progress and chilly social cli mate on the othercould be explained by telling stories about indians these placestories from millenniums end and new millenniums beginning for all their postindustrial irony and anomie sounded remarkably like those told generations earlier aging pioneers were replaced by aging lefties and upstart cheechakos shapeshifted into ven ture capitalists from california but otherwise the anxieties and conflicts were the same between native and newcomer between competing visions of urbanity between the past and the future again the debate centered on what kind of place seattle was and who belonged there and again imagined indians gave that debate its rhetorical heft this is perhaps the most powerful historical impulse in seattle to try to under stand the urban present through the native past often it is a noble compulsion inspired by the need to question economic avarice envi ronmental degradation or social disintegration but only when it is groundedin the specifics of local history and in the context of present day indian realitiesdoes the impulse become something more than blurryeyed nostalgia or insensitive mockery occasionally however there are moments when seattle native pasts have been connected in meaningful ways to its urban and indian present near the boundary between seattle and its southern neighbor tukwila hazelnut in chinook jargon three hills guard the duwamish river and its valley these were the hills that dosie wynns grandmother told t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s her about on trips to seattle from the muckleshoot reservation back in the s sharing stories of battles between north wind and storm wind and how the world came to be as it is members of the duwamish tribe for their part understood the landscape around the hills as the place where the world began but urban history had not been kind to the hills one had been quarried down to less than half its original size another had been bisected by a freeway exit and at the end of the twen tieth century the thirdknown locally as poverty hillwas put up for sale and was most likely going to be leveled then in a group of neighbors contacted local tribes and began to organize on behalf of poverty hill in the end the friends of duwamish riverbend hill raised over a million dollars to purchase and preserve the site through the aus pices of the cascade land conservancy on the summer solstice in the friends coalition came together to celebrate the hills preservation and unveiled plans for restoring the hills native ecosystems and for building trails with signs interpreting the duwamish valleys history local and state officials representatives of environmental organizations and most notably members of both the muckleshoot and duwamish tribes as well as indian people from other places all spoke of the impor tance of poverty hill as a symbol of racial reconciliation and faith in good government as muchneeded open space in an underserved indus trial neighborhood and as tribal cultural patrimony at poverty hill ecotopian impulses for restoration preservation and the everelusive sense of place intersected with tribal interests in protecting sacred sites and traditional cultural properties the key was that the parties involved moved beyond the metaphors indian people at poverty hill were not just symbols of an endangered landscape but active partners in and beneficiaries of its preservation but the desire to protect and restore urban nature using the native past can also make for bad history not far away from poverty hill for instance more than a thousand tons of contaminated soil has been removed to create a new estuarine refuge for salmon on the polluted and channelized duwamish river named herrings house park after the indigenous town razed in the site aims to link restoration to local history the problem however is that the park is in the wrong place it is not on the site of herrings house which is downstream it is on the site of basketry hat herrings house was a more ecologi cal name though and so marketing trumped history meanwhile iron ically nativeplant restoration on the site obliterated some of the last visible evidence of seattle indigenous geography broken shells that were part of basketry hats middens in this case restoring and repackaging the landscape for ecotopian seattle has only further mud dled this places history meanwhile across the street a large sign pro claims that someday if the funding far less than the cost of restoring the park can ever be found the duwamish tribe will have a longhouse here again in repairing seattle landscape restorationists were also restorying that landscape like city leaders warning of indianborne apocalypse in seattle illahee of the s tilikums using totem poles to sell the city in the s and pioneer descendants playing indian to lament urban growth in the s restorationists were using the native past to understand and in some ways to mitigate the urban present but restoration of indigenous places is deeply problematic there is no guar antee that the salmon or anything else can be brought back or that such efforts will actually improve the material conditions of modern indian lives the question remains then good intentions aside whom do these placestories of restoration truly benefit to when and to whom is what being restored exactly o bservers of us history have often written that one of the central american cultural projects has been to find a way to belong here on this continent to craft an iden tity from old world origins and new world circumstances very often that project has involved using indian imagery to tell amer ican stories boston tea party activists dressed as indians james fen imore coopers leatherstocking tales the ymcas indian guides chief seattle fifth gospel but this need to become native in order to be amer ican runs counter to the real history of our nations engagements with indigenous societies for every buckskinclad frontier hero of amer ican folklore there was a sand creek or trail of tears for every liter t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s ary noble savage there was a smallpox blanket or a boarding school for every new age ecoshaman there was a missionarys insult or a game wardens handcuffs if the chief american cultural project has been to bury indian facts under american fictions then perhaps the new project in seattle case means moving beyond the recycled placestories beyond the seeming inability of indian and urban histories to coexist and understanding the work our stories have done in this place what they have ignored what they have allowed whom they have benefited one way to begin is through knowing and sharing the history that has woven lives together in the city and its hinterland and imagining what might have been different in facing east from indian country his provocative account of early american history from the vantage point of the continents indigenous peoples historian daniel richter has argued that the chaos and violence of that history were never inevitable indi ans and whites had to learn to hate each other this is also true on puget sound where the future was never preordained and where the idea that indian history and urban history were somehow separate had to be cre ated in town ordinances and racial theories transmitted through pio neer memoirs and potlatch parades and literally built into the environment through ship canals and historic districts comprehend ing native pasts entails connecting urban and indian histories and understanding the processes through which indigenous places have been dispossessed expropriated and transformed it means knowing the his tory of the indigenous peoples on whose homelands seattle was built the shilsholes and lakes and duwamish and suquamish and muck leshoots as well as the history of the native peoples and territories who have been drawn into the city urban orbit the sklallams and tlin gits and coeur dalenes and aleuts and blackfeet unearthing seattle native pasts requires us also to look critically at which stories we tell about our shared past and why we tell them lastly it demands that we see the ways in which native people have actively contributed to shaped or resisted those stories stories matter throughout seattle history actions have sprung out of stories just as actionstidelands filled basket weavers paid bow and arrow joints shut downhave in turn resulted in new narratives about this place and who belongs here at the beginning of the twenty first century seattle urban palimpsest surely has room for new sto ries it is possible as some of the elders once said that the horned serpents are gone banished by too many houses and too much change there are so many moments where seattle history might have gone in other directions a longhouse unburned a mortuary pole left where it stood a lake not lowered we may look back but we cannot go back the past will not be undone for better or worse this native history belongs to us all daniel richter writes continuing by saying that under standing that past might allow us to find ways to focus more produc tively on our future perhaps in the revival of indigenous placenames and in powwows at daybreak star in the growing respect for the treaties and in every college diploma earned by an indian in the restoration of urban nature and in the willingness to challenge narratives of progress there is hope that seattle native pastor more accurately its many native pasts can be unearthed these placestories linked to urban and indian presents and futures will not simply be cautionary tales smug jokes or nostalgic fantasies but will be dialogues about the transformations of landscape and power in the city and about strategies for living together humanely in this place bringing new stories to light and considering how those stories can inform new kinds of action should be our agenda for the future and it is crafted in the moments when we simply ask each other what happened here t h e r e t u r n i n g h o s t s notes the haunted city only a handful of north american places use
