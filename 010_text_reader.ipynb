Among the most vocal of those concerned\n","\n","was writer Fred Moody, who had spent years chronicling the high-tech\n","\n","industry’s effects on the region. He lamented the loss of a more work-\n","\n","ing-class, slower-paced Seattle, a place his intellectual forebear, the iras-\n","\n","cible newspaperman Emmett Watson, had dubbed “Lesser Seattle” back\n","\n","in the 1970s. Moody’s lament drew from the Native past:\n","\n","The better the city’s material prospects, the worse its psychological pros-\n","\n","pects. I sat up late one night and regarded the history of Seattle as a history\n","\n","of diminishment, boom by boom. I remembered reading . . . how the tribes\n","\n","finally were forcibly put on a boat and sent out into the sound. . . . Now I saw\n","\n","their expulsion as equal parts exile and deliverance. They were our first lesser\n","\n","Seattleites. Fully aware that a material boom would bring a spiritual bust to\n","\n","their homeland, they served by their very existence to mock the pretensions\n","\n","of newcomers intent on bringing civilization and wealth to the Northwest’s\n","\n","paradise.\n","\n","In Moody’s estimation, the Seattle of Microsoft, Starbucks, and Ama-\n","\n","zon.com had gone overboard: “New-York-Pretty-Soon had grown into\n","\n","More-Than-New-York-Right-Now,” he complained, continuing that\n","\n","Seattleites like him and his downwardly mobile friends were “practi-\n","\n","cally the next best thing to Native Americans.” Arguing that the\n","\n","defining characteristic of a “lesser Seattleite”—and of lesser Seattle\n","\n","itself—was the forswearing of ambition, Moody realized that the ques-\n","\n","tion “What kind of city is Seattle becoming?” was also “What the hell\n","\n","am I turning into?” The interesting thing was how crucial Indians were\n","\n","to the answer.26\n","\n","On the other side of the debate over Seattle’s soul, Robert Ferrigno,\n","\n","a contributor to Microsoft’s online Slate magazine, pointed out that Seat-\n","\n","2 0 2\n","\n","\n","\n","tle’s problems in fact stemmed from the “sloth and poor economic poli-\n","\n","cies of its other tenants: Indians, Scandinavians, and hippies.” The\n","\n","indigenous tradition of the potlatch, Ferrigno claimed, had prevented\n","\n","“research and development,” and the potlatch’s supposed values (“No\n","\n","investments. No competition. No ego. No progress.”) had prevented\n","\n","Northwest Indians and their slow-growth descendants from reaping the\n","\n","rewards of urban achievement. A similar story about the so-called Seat-\n","\n","tle Freeze, the idea that people in the city are superficially friendly but\n","\n","distant and hard to get to know, meanwhile, referred back to Emmett\n","\n","Watson’s tongue-in-cheek claim that “Seattle” was “Indian for ‘stay away\n","\n","from here.’” According to these observers of local culture, both the best\n","\n","and worst things about Seattle—its disappearing authenticity, on the\n","\n","one hand, and its stubborn resistance to progress and chilly social cli-\n","\n","mate, on the other—could be explained by telling stories about Indians.27\n","\n","These place-stories from millennium’s end and new millennium’s\n","\n","beginning, for all their postindustrial irony and anomie, sounded\n","\n","remarkably like those told generations earlier. Aging pioneers were\n","\n","replaced by aging lefties and upstart cheechakos shape-shifted into ven-\n","\n","ture capitalists from California, but otherwise, the anxieties and conflicts\n","\n","were the same: between native and newcomer, between competing\n","\n","visions of urbanity, between the past and the future. Again, the debate\n","\n","centered on what kind of place Seattle was and who belonged there,\n","\n","and again, imagined Indians gave that debate its rhetorical heft. This\n","\n","is perhaps the most powerful historical impulse in Seattle: to try to under-\n","\n","stand the urban present through the Native past. Often, it is a noble\n","\n","compulsion, inspired by the need to question economic avarice, envi-\n","\n","ronmental degradation, or social disintegration. But only when it is\n","\n","grounded—in the specifics of local history and in the context of present-\n","\n","day Indian realities—does the impulse become something more than\n","\n","blurry-eyed nostalgia or insensitive mockery. \n","\n","Occasionally, however, there are moments when Seattle’s Native pasts\n","\n","have been connected in meaningful ways to its urban and Indian present.\n","\n","Near the boundary between Seattle and its southern neighbor Tukwila\n","\n","(“hazelnut” in Chinook Jargon), three hills guard the Duwamish River\n","\n","and its valley. These were the hills that Dosie Wynn’s grandmother told\n","\n","T H E  R E T U R N I N G  H O S T S  /  2 0 3\n","\n","\n","\n","her about on trips to Seattle from the Muckleshoot Reservation back in\n","\n","the 1930s, sharing stories of battles between North Wind and Storm\n","\n","Wind and how the world came to be as it is. Members of the Duwamish\n","\n","Tribe, for their part, understood the landscape around the hills as the\n","\n","place where the world began. But urban history had not been kind to\n","\n","the hills: one had been quarried down to less than half its original size,\n","\n","another had been bisected by a freeway exit, and at the end of the twen-\n","\n","tieth century, the third—known locally as Poverty Hill—was put up for\n","\n","sale and was most likely going to be leveled. Then in 2000, a group of\n","\n","neighbors contacted local tribes and began to organize on behalf of\n","\n","Poverty Hill. In the end, the Friends of Duwamish Riverbend Hill raised\n","\n","over a million dollars to purchase and preserve the site through the aus-\n","\n","pices of the Cascade Land Conservancy. On the summer solstice in 2004,\n","\n","the Friends’ coalition came together to celebrate the hill’s preservation\n","\n","and unveiled plans for restoring the hill’s native ecosystems and for\n","\n","building trails with signs interpreting the Duwamish Valley’s history.\n","\n","Local and state officials, representatives of environmental organizations,\n","\n","and, most notably, members of both the Muckleshoot and Duwamish\n","\n","tribes (as well as Indian people from other places), all spoke of the impor-\n","\n","tance of Poverty Hill: as a symbol of racial reconciliation and faith in\n","\n","good government, as much-needed open space in an underserved indus-\n","\n","trial neighborhood, and as tribal cultural patrimony. At Poverty Hill,\n","\n","ecotopian impulses for restoration, preservation, and the ever-elusive\n","\n","“sense of place” intersected with tribal interests in protecting sacred\n","\n","sites and traditional cultural properties. The key was that the parties\n","\n","involved moved beyond the metaphors. Indian people at Poverty Hill\n","\n","were not just symbols of an endangered landscape but active partners\n","\n","in, and beneficiaries of, its preservation.28\n","\n","But the desire to protect and restore urban nature using the Native\n","\n","past can also make for bad history. Not far away from Poverty Hill, for\n","\n","instance, more than a thousand tons of contaminated soil has been\n","\n","removed to create a new estuarine refuge for salmon on the polluted\n","\n","and channelized Duwamish River. Named Herring’s House Park after\n","\n","the indigenous town razed in 1893, the site aims to link restoration to\n","\n","local history. The problem, however, is that the park is in the wrong\n","\n","2 0 4\n","\n","\n","\n","place: it is not on the site of Herring’s House, which is downstream; it\n","\n","is on the site of Basketry Hat. Herring’s House was a more “ecologi-\n","\n","cal” name, though, and so marketing trumped history. Meanwhile, iron-\n","\n","ically, native-plant restoration on the site obliterated some of the last\n","\n","visible evidence of Seattle’s indigenous geography: broken shells that\n","\n","were part of Basketry Hat’s middens. In this case, restoring (and\n","\n","repackaging) the landscape for ecotopian Seattle has only further mud-\n","\n","dled this place’s history. Meanwhile, across the street, a large sign pro-\n","\n","claims that someday, if the funding (far less than the cost of restoring\n","\n","the park) can ever be found, the Duwamish Tribe will have a longhouse\n","\n","here again.29\n","\n","In repairing Seattle’s landscape, restorationists were also re-storying\n","\n","that landscape. Like city leaders warning of Indian-borne apocalypse\n","\n","in Seattle Illahee of the 1870s, Tilikums using totem poles to sell the\n","\n","city in the 1910s, and pioneer descendants playing Indian to lament\n","\n","urban growth in the 1930s, restorationists were using the Native past\n","\n","to understand, and in some ways to mitigate, the urban present. But\n","\n","restoration of indigenous places is deeply problematic: there is no guar-\n","\n","antee that the salmon or anything else can be brought back or that such\n","\n","efforts will actually improve the material conditions of modern Indian\n","\n","lives. The question remains, then: good intentions aside, whom do these\n","\n","place-stories of “restoration” truly benefit? To when, and to whom, is what\n","\n","being restored, exactly?\n","\n","O\n","bservers of u.s. history have often written that one\n","\n","of the central American cultural projects has been to find\n","\n","a way to belong here on this continent, to craft an iden-\n","\n","tity from Old World origins and New World circumstances.\n","\n","Very often, that project has involved using Indian imagery to tell Amer-\n","\n","ican stories: Boston Tea Party activists dressed as Indians, James Fen-\n","\n","imore Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales, the YMCA’s Indian Guides, Chief\n","\n","Seattle’s fifth Gospel. But this need to become Native in order to be Amer-\n","\n","ican runs counter to the real history of our nation’s engagements with\n","\n","indigenous societies. For every buckskin-clad frontier hero of Amer-\n","\n","ican folklore, there was a Sand Creek or Trail of Tears; for every liter-\n","\n","T H E  R E T U R N I N G  H O S T S  /  2 0 5\n","\n","\n","\n","ary Noble Savage, there was a smallpox blanket or a boarding school;\n","\n","for every New Age eco-shaman there was a missionary’s insult or a game\n","\n","warden’s handcuffs. If the chief American cultural project has been to\n","\n","bury Indian facts under American fictions, then perhaps the new project\n","\n","in Seattle’s case, means moving beyond the recycled place-stories—\n","\n","beyond the seeming inability of Indian and urban histories to coexist—\n","\n","and understanding the work our stories have done in this place: what\n","\n","they have ignored, what they have allowed, whom they have benefited.\n","\n","One way to begin is through knowing, and sharing, the history that\n","\n","has woven lives together in the city and its hinterland, and imagining\n","\n","what might have been different. In Facing East from Indian Country, his\n","\n","provocative account of early American history from the vantage point\n","\n","of the continent’s indigenous peoples, historian Daniel Richter has argued\n","\n","that the chaos and violence of that history were never inevitable. Indi-\n","\n","ans and whites had to learn to hate each other. This is also true on Puget\n","\n","Sound, where the future was never preordained and where the idea that\n","\n","Indian history and urban history were somehow separate had to be cre-\n","\n","ated in town ordinances and racial theories, transmitted through pio-\n","\n","neer memoirs and Potlatch parades, and literally built into the\n","\n","environment through ship canals and historic districts. Comprehend-\n","\n","ing Native pasts entails connecting urban and Indian histories and\n","\n","understanding the processes through which indigenous places have been\n","\n","dispossessed, expropriated, and transformed. It means knowing the his-\n","\n","tory of the indigenous peoples on whose homelands Seattle was built,\n","\n","the Shilsholes and Lakes and Duwamish and Suquamish and Muck-\n","\n","leshoots, as well as the history of the Native peoples and territories who\n","\n","have been drawn into the city’s urban orbit, the S’Klallams and Tlin-\n","\n","gits and Coeur d’Alenes and Aleuts and Blackfeet. Unearthing Seattle’s\n","\n","Native pasts requires us also to look critically at which stories we tell\n","\n","about our shared past and why we tell them. Lastly, it demands that we\n","\n","see the ways in which Native people have actively contributed to,\n","\n","shaped, or resisted those stories.30\n","\n","Stories matter. Throughout Seattle’s history, actions have sprung out\n","\n","of stories, just as actions—tidelands filled, basket weavers paid, “bow\n","\n","and arrow joints” shut down—have in turn resulted in new narratives\n","\n","2 0 6\n","\n","\n","\n","about this place and who belongs here. At the beginning of the twenty-\n","\n","first century, Seattle’s urban palimpsest surely has room for new sto-\n","\n","ries. It is possible, as some of the elders once said, that the horned\n","\n","serpents are gone, banished by “too many houses” and too much change.\n","\n","There are so many moments where Seattle’s history might have gone\n","\n","in other directions: a longhouse unburned, a mortuary pole left where\n","\n","it stood, a lake not lowered. We may look back, but we cannot go back.\n","\n","The past will not be undone. “For better or worse, this native history\n","\n","belongs to us all,” Daniel Richter writes, continuing by saying that under-\n","\n","standing that past might allow us to “find ways to focus more produc-\n","\n","tively on our future.”31\n","\n","Perhaps in the revival of indigenous place-names and in powwows\n","\n","at Daybreak Star, in the growing respect for the treaties and in every\n","\n","college diploma earned by an Indian, in the restoration of urban nature\n","\n","and in the willingness to challenge narratives of progress, there is hope\n","\n","that Seattle’s Native past—or, more accurately, its many Native pasts—\n","\n","can be unearthed. These place-stories, linked to urban and Indian\n","\n","presents and futures, will not simply be cautionary tales, smug jokes,\n","\n","or nostalgic fantasies but will be dialogues about the transformations\n","\n","of landscape and power in the city and about strategies for living together\n","\n","humanely in this place. Bringing new stories to light and considering\n","\n","how those stories can inform new kinds of action should be our agenda\n","\n","for the future, and it is crafted in the moments when we simply ask\n","\n","each other, What happened here?\n","\n","T H E  R E T U R N I N G  H O S T S  /  2 0 7\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","NOTES\n","\n","1 / The Haunted City\n","\n","1.
